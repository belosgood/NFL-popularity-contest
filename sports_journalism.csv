(0:57)HENDERSON, Nev. -- Jon Gruden's post-victory media conference after his Las Vegas Raiders defeated the Denver Broncos on Sunday was all of 75 seconds old when he put a damper on things.Picture downtrodden Chucky with a frown and a wet blanket, rather than maniacal Chucky with a grin and a blade.""Well, it is satisfying,"" Gruden said after dropping 37 points on the Broncos while picking off four passes, racking up two sacks, forcing a fumble and limiting Denver to zero yards in the third quarter of a 37-12 win that improved the Raiders to 6-3, 3-0 in the AFC West.And yet ...Best of NFL Nation‚Ä¢ Lamar, Ravens in offensive free fall

‚Ä¢ Can Packers' MVS find consistency?""But we don't have much time to celebrate,"" Gruden added. ""As you know, we have to play the Chiefs this week.""Ah yes, the defending Super Bowl champions. A juggernaut that has lost all of one game in the last calendar year. And, of course, that defeat came at the hands of (to quote Gruden), as you know, Gruden's Raiders.Back on Oct. 11. At Arrowhead Stadium. Which was followed, to quote Gruden again, as you know, by a victory lap around the stadium by the team bus. Much to Chiefs coach Andy Reid's chagrin.""They won the game, so they can do anything they want to do,"" an irritated Reid said Monday. ""That's not our style.""Gruden was amused.""I mean, you can find a smart-aleck bus driver in Kansas City who made some snide comments when we got on the bus,"" Gruden said Monday. ""Maybe that's why we drove around the stadium -- to tick him off. You know, this is ridiculous. Next question.""Gruden was still smiling, though.Raiders-Chiefs week is always a big deal in Raider Nation and Chiefs Kingdom, even if one team is dominating the series, as Kansas City has since Reid landed as Chiefs coach in 2013.Since then, the Chiefs have won 12 of 15 meetings.But when you break it down further, a strange scheduling quirk reveals itself -- this will be the fourth time in five seasons, the third year in a row, that Kansas City will face the Raiders as the Chiefs come off their bye week.""I'm sure that's just a coincidence,"" a now irritated Gruden said, his tongue pressed firmly in cheek. ""You know, I'm sure it's a coincidence.""A four-second pregnant pause ensued.""I don't think about it,"" Gruden continued. ""The schedule is the schedule. You've got to adapt to it and that's what we'll do.""Consider: in the previous three meetings between the teams that have followed Kansas City's bye, the Chiefs are 3-0 and have outscored the Raiders by a combined 106-52, or by an average score of 35-17.Ouch.The last two such meetings, in 2018 and 2019, have occurred in Week 13, in Oakland and then in Kansas City.This one, obviously, is different in that it will go down in Las Vegas. And the Raiders are essentially playing with house money, with a win over the Chiefs in hand and an eye on a potential playoff spot.""Always excited to win,"" said Raiders quarterback Derek Carr, who got one monkey off his back with his first victory at Arrowhead Stadium in seven tries.""[Being] 6-3 and 3-0 in the division is a big deal. The division still goes through Kansas City.""Who's trending up and who has a ways to go? NFL Nation reporters provide a progress report on all 255 drafted players and more. Story ¬ªAs it did in 2016, the last time the Raiders had a winning record and went to the playoffs. Both the Raiders and Chiefs were 12-4 but Kansas City won the division by virtue of its season sweep of the Raiders. And, ahem, as you know, the first meeting that year came after a Chiefs bye, in Week 5, when Kansas City entered that game 2-2.Coincidence? Meh. It does not matter. Not when the Chiefs are living rent-free in Las Vegas' head.For this week at least.""Jeff [Heath] made a big play that ignited us against the Chiefs,"" Gruden said, comparing Heath's two first-half interceptions against Denver to his fourth-quarter pick of Patrick Mahomes in the Raiders' 40-32 win at Kansas City last month. ""And boy, we're going to need him next week because we have a great team coming to town.""You have a lot of respect for how hard it is to win in this league and you try to enjoy it for a couple hours and then you have to get up early and get ready for the next one. And this is a big one, obviously.""As you know."
1,chiefs,https://www.espn.com/blog/kansas-city-chiefs,Why Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes-to-Travis Kelce connection is the best of its time,"Patrick Mahomes is announced as a member of the elite Madden 99 club for the second straight year. (0:55)KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The margin for error was already slim in the second quarter of last season's divisional round playoff game against the Houston Texans, so it's no coincidence quarterback Patrick Mahomes went looking for tight end Travis Kelce to rally the Kansas City Chiefs.Using their backyard brand of football, Mahomes threw three touchdown passes to Kelce in the quarter as the Chiefs overcame a 24-point deficit to lead by halftime and eventually win the game. It's just one example of what makes Mahomes and Kelce -- teammates on the field and friends off it -- the best pass-catch combination of their time.Against the Texans in January, the chemistry was obvious. On third-and-goal from the Houston 6 with the Chiefs down 10, Kelce took his route as planned toward the right sideline. But he saw an open pocket in the Texans' coverage back toward the middle of the field. That's where Kelce headed and it was exactly where Mahomes wanted him.ONE. POSSESSION. GAME. pic.twitter.com/nAuEFXmJmQThe improvised route resulted in a touchdown and left the Chiefs one score away from overtaking the Texans. They did so minutes later on another Mahomes-to-Kelce pass.""His understanding of coverages and how he runs routes is special,"" Mahomes said of Kelce. ""I think that's the best thing about his game. Obviously, he's physically gifted and he's a mismatch for guys on the field -- linebackers, corners, whoever it is.""But the way that he's able to run routes versus coverages and adjust his routes to be right in the right spot at the right time is special. It's something that helps me out a ton. ... It's stuff that not everybody understands. I think it's just him thinking like a quarterback and understanding the whole concept of the play by getting other people open and getting himself open when he needs to get open.""Over the past three seasons, Mahomes and Kelce have connected on 25 touchdown passes. That's by far the most for a quarterback and tight end during that span and puts them in the company of other greats of the past decade. Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski had 25 with the Patriots from 2015 through 2017, and Drew Brees and Jimmy Graham had 26 for the Saints from 2013 through 2015.Mahomes and Kelce have plenty of time to pass them this season, beginning Sunday night against the Las Vegas Raiders (8:20 p.m. ET, NBC). Frustrated opponents seem to have no doubt that they will.""They definitely have karma between them,"" said Denver coach Vic Fangio, who watched Kelce catch 11 Mahomes passes for 142 yards in the snow against the Broncos last season. ""They can ad-lib the routes, and both of them are on the same page when they're doing that.""He's a really tough guy to cover. He's got size. He's got great route-running instincts, when to pivot and when not to pivot, when to stay with the exact route. Obviously Mahomes is very comfortable throwing it to him because he's a big guy, and a lot of times he's on a [defensive back] so he outsizes him, but yet he runs really good routes.""A post shared by Patrick Mahomes II (@patrickmahomes)Fangio calls it karma. Others might refer to it as chemistry. It could be enhanced by the fact the two are friends off the field. They've attended sporting events such as the Final Four together. Following their Super Bowl LIV victory parade the pair showed up together at a Post Malone concert. They participated together over the summer in the American Century Celebrity Golf Tournament at Lake Tahoe. It was Kelce who presented Mahomes with his Madden NFL 2020 ""99 chain"" signifying his perfect rating in the video game.Unusual is the play where Mahomes and Kelce don't see the same thing. One example of their synchronization is the playoff touchdown against the Texans.Another is the first quarter of the Week 6 game this season against the Buffalo Bills. With the Chiefs at the Bills' 11, Kelce found an open spot in the defense after leading a defender one way and then cutting back the other. Mahomes held the ball until Kelce could get there.Trav gets us the lead üèπüì≤ https://t.co/yU4jLvie5Y pic.twitter.com/5YAwwmgHcsThe play got the attention of ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky as he watched the game.""I don't know this, and this is something of an assumption from me, but I would imagine both of those kids had very unrestrictive parents, meaning their parents just let them go play in the yard,"" Orlovsky said. ""They didn't need private coaching on how to run a 40 or private coaching on how to throw. They kind of acquired their skill sets from playing tag in the yard or out in the street.""This is something that's directly tied to their experiences as youths. I totally believe in that. They both have outstanding spatial awareness. They both feel color more than they feel people. Blurs are very slow for them. Me? I see a blur and I'm stunned by it. Them? They see blurs and it moves much slower for them. They're very not-structured. That touchdown is the perfect example of it. ... They have the same kind of skills when it comes to that.""Kelce is the first NFL tight end to have four straight 1,000-yard seasons and needs 231 yards over the Chiefs' final seven games to get a fifth. At the rate he's going, Kelce will get to 1,000 yards in three more games.Relive the NFL's greatest games, original series and more. Watch on ESPN+Kelce played quarterback in high school and some as a freshman in college at the University of Cincinnati. He said that experience helps him decipher coverages.""I see the coverage, see what they're in and ... I know where the ball is going to go,"" Kelce said. ""The biggest thing in terms of route running for me is knowing what the defense is in, knowing the coverage. Once you know the coverage, now you can start manipulating the defense. You can start to try to trick them in where you want to go and where you want to get open.""Kelce played hockey and basketball when he was younger and indicated some of the skills he picked up transfer to football. In particular, Kelce changes directions easily for a 260-pound player.""Just putting my foot in the ground and being able to get a big body to change direction, I think that's huge,"" he said. ""I don't think a lot of tight ends incorporate that enough.""I got a lot of that from playing hockey when I was younger, being able to play on the inside and outside of skates, as well as just being on the basketball court being able to put my foot into the ground and cross over. ... Just being able to incorporate other sports into my game has definitely helped me out.""The result is usually ugly for the Chiefs when Mahomes and Kelce have the unusual play where things go wrong between them. Mahomes' only interception of the season came on a pass intended for Kelce in the Chiefs' only loss, in Week 5 against the Raiders.After the game, Mahomes without naming any specific receivers said the Chiefs needed to ""just execute the offense the way that it's called and the way it's supposed to be [executed].""I HAVE TO BE BETTER!! For my teammates and coaches.... this loss is on me... and the only way to fix it is to go to work ASAP!!Kelce took blame for the loss on Twitter.""I still get frustrated watching that film,"" Kelce said recently. ""Later in the game, I got a little frustrated trying to make more out of a play than what it was. I was running routes that weren't called, and I screwed the team doing it. Stuff that you won't see on film, that you won't see on the stats but something that I took personally. It was just me being frustrated and trying to be there for my quarterback doing the right things, which I wasn't doing. I've just got to play within the system and run the plays that are called.""We have a lot of freedom in this offense to try to kind of go out there and make plays. It's had its history of having success. Sometimes it works but at that point in the game there was no leeway. I couldn't do that, and I screwed the team because of it.""That type of thing doesn't happen often between Mahomes and Kelce, particularly in the red zone. Mahomes has completed nine of 12 passes with six touchdowns when targeting Kelce in the red zone this season. It's one reason Kelce, who has six touchdowns, could break his career high of 10, set in 2018.""They have a great system that's designed to get the ball to the tight end,"" Carolina coach Matt Rhule said before the Panthers' game against the Chiefs. ""If you go all the way back to [coach] Andy [Reid's] time in Philadelphia, the tight end has always been a huge part of that offense.‚Ä¢ Lamar, Ravens in offensive free fall

‚Ä¢ Can Packers' MVS find consistency?""The coaches have done a great job of incorporating multiple ways to get the ball to the tight end. [Kelce and Mahomes] just do it really well.""Reid had some good pass-catchers at tight end during his 14 seasons with the Eagles, but Kelce was his first 1,000-yard receiver at the position. And Kelce's numbers are better since Mahomes became the starting quarterback in 2018. His two best seasons in terms of catches and yards are the two full seasons with Mahomes and this season could wind up as the best of them all.While Mahomes has been good for Kelce, it's just as true the tight end has been good for the quarterback.""Obviously, I'm a big fan of Pat's,"" Kelce said. ""I think he's the best player in the National Football League. You can't tell me there's a better quarterback than him, that's for sure.""When Pat got into the huddle, it was just a little bit different. I think he brought a different energy, different style to the game that even I was a little more accustomed to, just going out and playing ball in the backyard type of football. As he progresses, as he starts to learn more about defenses and gets into the defensive coordinators' minds, his game is just going to keep going up and up until probably something that we've never seen before -- if what he's doing already isn't something that we've never seen before. It's a fun time to be a Kansas City Chief, and it's because 15 is in the building, for sure."""

‚Ä¢ Can Packers' MVS find consistency?They've seen this before. A seemingly breakout game only to regress to -- or below -- the mean. The ghosts are there: one catch for 4 yards last October a week after a 133-yard game or one catch for 19 yards two weeks after a 99-yard game in September.This time, LaFleur and Rodgers have reason to believe it will be different.Or at least legitimate hope.The deep ball, including Sunday's 78-yard touchdown in the 24-20 win over the Jaguars, is one thing: With his 4.37-speed, he has five touchdowns of at least 40 yards since the start of the 2019 season to rank tied for third-most in the NFL in that span. But it was his other three catches on Sunday that resonated with the coach and quarterback.""It starts with the deep threat,"" Rodgers said after the game. ""We need to keep finding ways to get him other routes. I think the growth we're going to see from him is where he becomes more than just a one-dimensional guy. But I will say there are a couple plays that I really, really liked today from him.""They looked like this:Third-and-6 at their own 23-yard line in the second quarter, and Rodgers has to buy time by moving to his right. Valdes-Scantling follows him and finds an opening for a body catch and a 22-yard gain on a drive that leads to a touchdown.With Davante Adams getting checked out for an ankle injury in the third quarter, Valdes-Scantling does his best Adams impersonation by turning a shallow cross on a designed rollout -- what LaFleur calls a ""keeper"" -- and turning it upfield for a 31-yard catch and run.From the slot left and with Adams to the outside, Valdes-Scantling takes a bubble screen and turns it into a tackle-breaking 18-yard pickup on a fourth-quarter scoring drive.""He was flying off the ball on the keeper, on that low cross, and Aaron threw a great ball to him and, shoot, I think we got 30-some yards,"" LaFleur said. ""That's rare, and that's a credit to his speed and attacking it and catching the ball with his hands.""I think the most impressive play from a receiving standpoint was the bubble we threw him on the go-ahead scoring drive. Just the finish that he showed with two defenders closing in on him, his ability to split those guys and pick up extra yardage, I thought that was big time of him.""All that after a two-touchdown game (his only two catches) in the previous week's win over the 49ers.Progress for sure, but can he fix his inconsistency (and his drops) or will the Packers just have to live with it?Even after the last two games, Valdes-Scantling still ranks 152nd among 153 qualified receivers in catch percentage (50%), according to ESPN Stats & information. He was below 50% until he caught four of his six targets against the Jaguars. He ranks second among those receivers in drops (five).Still, Rodgers has continually talked him up this year. Only he knows if that's real trust or just a quarterback trying to boost his mercurial receiver's confidence. With Allen Lazard expected to come off injured reserve this week and likely return to his role as WR2, it could mean fewer chances for Valdes-Scantling if he doesn't continue to deliver.But know this: Rodgers had enough faith to listen to him right before the deep ball touchdown on Sunday.""The previous play we had thrown a quick out route to Davante and I had run a go route on the previous play and saw that I could get behind [Jaguars cornerback Sidney Jones],"" Valdes-Scantling said. ""He wasn't really respecting deep, so I went back to the huddle and told Aaron that I can get by him. The next play we went out and threw a go ball."""
4,cowboys,https://www.espn.com/blog/dallas-cowboys,Dallas Cowboys staffers using bubble to battle COVID-19,"FRISCO, Texas -- As the country experiences a surge in COVID-19 cases, the Dallas Cowboys are going above the NFL's intensive protocols by having staff members who are in direct contact with the players go into a bubble similar to the one the team employed during training camp.Speaking on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said, ""Everybody's emphasizing, 'Don't let your guard down.'"" The team is stepping up its isolation by having coaches and staff stay at the Omni Hotel at The Star, according to multiple sources.""We're going in a more intense way, and we're having our coaches restrict their activities away from the field and restrict their contacts away from the field,"" Jones told the team's flagship network. ""We're having all staff that touch a player do that. That's in addition to what the NFL is doing.""The Cowboys moved into intensive protocols last week during their bye week after a Pittsburgh Steelers player tested positive after their game against Dallas. The Cowboys did not have an in-person practice last week but held a virtual meeting.They returned to The Star on Monday for meetings and a walk-through and will continue for the week, according to coach Mike McCarthy. Because of the size of The Star with the 12,000-seat Ford Center, the Cowboys have the room to spread out meetings to remain socially distanced.In training camp, players stayed at the Omni, creating their own version of a bubble. Due to the collective bargaining agreement, teams can't mandate that players stay at a hotel during the regular season. Jones said he was not sure if the league would move to a bubble format for the playoffs, similar to the NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball.""Don't let your guard down because tomorrow all of that could change,"" Jones said. ""And that's a fact. Don't let me think for one second we've got the key to how to not have this COVID outbreak. We don't. But the things we're doing are working here.""Jones said he assumes anybody he comes in contact with has the coronavirus, and he wears two masks. He also said he would take the vaccine when it becomes available.Yet Jones is not at the point where he will cut back attendance at AT&T Stadium. In five games, the Cowboys have had 128,750 fans, averaging 25,750 per game as the team follows guidelines set forth by the state, the NFL and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Jones said his plan was to increase fans as the season went on. The Cowboys had 31,700 attend the Pittsburgh game.""I'm very proud of the fact that we do it safely, we do it smartly,"" Jones said. ""Our fans are really helpful, to say the very least, in playing in front of those fans. I see a continued aggressive approach to having fans out there. We'll see. That's not being insensitive to the fact that we've got our COVID and an outbreak. Some say maybe it is, but not when we're doing it as safe as we are, and not when you're having the results we are. Literally, we have had no one report that they've had any contact with COVID from coming to our game. No one."""

Left tackle David Bakhtiari was scheduled to become a free agent after this season, but according to Pro Football Talk, he signed a new four-year contract extension overnight before Sunday‚Äôs game.This move locks up the left side of the Packers‚Äô line for the foreseeable future and gives Bakhtiari financial security heading into his age-30 season in 2021. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports that the contract has about $23 million per year in new money on the new deal, which will lock him in through the 2024 season.Bakhtiari finally earned first-team All-Pro honors in 2018 after consistently being one of the best pass-blockers in the NFL for several years. Along with second-year pro Elgton Jenkins at guard, the Packers have one of the finest left sides of the offensive line in the league. Bakhtiari returned to the field on Sunday for the game against Jacksonville after missing three games with a chest injury.This also marks the second time that Bakhtiari has signed a contract extension before a game against the Jaguars. He signed his first big deal just before week one of the 2016 season, when Green Bay traveled to Jacksonville for the season opener.The Packers were set to have two starting offensive linemen hitting free agency next spring, with center Corey Linsley joining Bakhtiari in needing a new contract. With the NFL‚Äôs salary cap seemingly set to drop significantly in 2021 due to COVID-19, the Packers will likely find it difficult to pay both of these players for next season and beyond, so this could spell the end for Linsley in Green Bay.Stay tuned for more information about Bakhtiari‚Äôs contract moving forward."

The Packers did enough against the Jaguars, but only barely.On a windy, raw, bone-chilling day at Lambeau Field, the color that stood out wasn‚Äôt the turquoise details on the Jacksonville Jaguars jerseys, with the AFC South squad making a rare trip to Green Bay. It was blaze orange, or rather, the lack of it, as the aluminum stands rattled empty despite the fans‚Äô beloved Packers making a Super Bowl push. Two weeks after Aaron Rodgers called out his team‚Äôs lack of energy at home in the cold against the Vikings, noting the inability to feed off the crowd, his squad once again came out flat on a cold day against a team on a seven-game losing streak.At least the fans have an excuse for not showing up, with Wisconsin COVID cases surging and the Packers avoiding adding to the spread on game day. Green Bay held on for a 24-20 victory, but it took a 4th-and-26 stop with just over a minute left to preserve a win that came much harder fought than most predicted.And it started right away. Not only did the Packers not score on the first drive of the game, something they‚Äôve done in every game this season, but the Jaguars forced a three-and-out, despite coming into the game last in passing and total defense by DVOA. The Jaguars out-gained the Packers in the first quarter despite being minus-40 in first quarter point differential this season, a worrying harbinger of things to come.Two turnovers and a 91-yard punt return touchdown by Keelan Cole, the longest in Jaguars history, kept the 1-7 Jags in a game where they were out-gained 395-260 and dominated in yards per play 6.6 to 4.3. The sloppy turnovers, a fumble by Davante Adams and a stupefying interception by Rodgers, embodied the lack of intensity and focus by the Packers. They sleep-walked to a play-to-play domination of Jacksonville, but the Jags played harder, tackled with more ferocity, and made every borderline play.Marquez Valdes-Scantling‚Äôs finest game as a Packer stood between the Jaguars and victory. His 78-yard bomb in the second quarter gave Green Bay its first lead and with Davante Adams hobbling in the second half, MVS came through with big catches for chunk yards, in all 149 yards on just 4 catches, all momentous in their own right.His play buoyed a run game the Packers couldn‚Äôt get going against a below average run defense. The Packers consistently win in the trenches this season and while they kept Rodgers clean to toss for 325 yards a 2 touchdowns, the run game sputtered for 80 yards on 30 carries.The play of MVS and a bit of history were the lone bright spots on a day that was otherwise just spotty. Davante Adams passed Don Hutson for 5th on the Packers all-time receptions list, while Aaron Rodgers eclipsed Warren Moon for 11th all-time in passing yards.Box scores can and often do lie, as they will for this game. Statistically, the game was only close on the scoreboard, but that‚Äôs also the place where the numbers matter most. This kind of execution won‚Äôt cut it against the better teams in the league no matter what fantasy football numbers come along with them.Winning as two touchdowns favorites wouldn‚Äôt change perception among some fans and media critics about whether or not this team can take a punch from a quality opponent. We‚Äôll have to wait at least a week for the chance to quiet the questions when they head to Indianapolis to take on the Colts. Then again, the Jags‚Äô only win this season came against those same Colts, a testament to the ‚Äúany given Sunday‚Äù clich√© and another reason not to dismiss a win, any win, as meaningless regardless of the opponent‚Äôs record.Jacksonville came out with more life, more verve, and more punch in their play. When the Packers ran receiver screens, the Jaguars defensive backs flew downhill, shook off blocks, and made tackles. When Jacksonville dialed up the same play, they‚Äôd find 10 yards. Despite coming in the worst defense in football by DVOA, Myles Jack and Co. flew around the field, relishing the big sticks and physical play in the trenches. Green Bay‚Äôs offensive line, one that has mauled just about every team it faced, played like a C-level effort would yield A results, a problem that plagued every facet of the Packers on Sunday, from coaching to offense, defense, and special teams.The cold can be no excuse, not for a team who wants to host games at Lambeau in even worse weather come January. Injuries also can‚Äôt absolve this sluggish performance, playing without Kevin King, Jaire Alexander and Allen Lazard. They‚Äôve played much more impressive games with far bigger injury problems. This is the worst team in the league plus or minus the Jets. Banking on a playoff atmosphere or the intensity of facing a playoff caliber team walks a perilous line for the Packers. These are the kinds of games Super Bowl contenders come out and decide they want to be over by halftime.That‚Äôs not to say the Packers are pretenders, or can‚Äôt go on to win a Super Bowl, but their performance against a team who hung them them because they wanted it more speaks to effort and resolve. More to the point, Jacksonville played more disciplined football, turning it over less often and not blowing gap integrity to give up a momentous punt return. If the Packers play their best game, they beat the Jaguars by 30, but they didn‚Äôt ... so they didn‚Äôt.Green Bay hasn‚Äôt won anything as currently constituted. There‚Äôs no switch to flip. The Packers have to bring the intensity every week in ways they haven‚Äôt this season despite their record. On the other hand, they don‚Äôt play the game to cover point spreads, just to win. And whether it‚Äôs in November or January, no team will apologize for winning. In scope of the season, this game only meant something if the Packers took the L. The true test awaits in Indianapolis and whether the Packers were looking ahead to that matchup, who‚Äôs to say? All that matters is they pass that test. Their C-game won‚Äôt cut it."

Making sense of a crowded NFC field,"FILED UNDER:We turn to EPA and DVOA to try to separate the contenders from the pretenders.First it was the Green Bay Packers staking their claim. In Week 3, they went down to New Orleans and came out with a victory over the Saints. Then it was the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who curb-stomped the Packers in week 6. This past weekend, it was now New Orleans once again, who, after racking up 30 kills, called in a tactical nuke on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. But remember, the Packers went into the Superdome and came out with a win not too long ago. Then there are the Seattle Seahawks, who had largely scraped by solely on their high powered passing attack, with narrow wins over lesser teams such as New England, Dallas, and Minnesota, until they were handed a double-digit loss by the Bills this past weekend. Then there‚Äôs the Los Angeles Rams, whose strong defense is pulling a ton of weight for a pretty average offense.So is anyone here actually great? Does anyone want the one-seed?There are quite literally endless ways to try and answer the ‚Äúgreat‚Äù question, but, per usual, I‚Äôm gonna let some stats do the work. Before I get too deep down that rabbit hole though, it‚Äôs important to understand some key ideas. Firstly, offensive performance is more predictive than defensive performance. If you have a good offense now, it is more likely that you‚Äôll have a good offense in the future than the same being said for defense. This is why year-over-year it is generally a good idea to fade teams who had historically great defenses the year prior (2020 Patriots, 2020 49ers, 2018 Jaguars, 2019 Bears). In order to try and account for this, you can weight offensive performance more heavily than defensive performance (you could also down-weight defense, you‚Äôd get to the same point).The two stats I‚Äôm going to use to analyze the teams are EPA/play and DVOA. For the offensive version of each of these stats, I am going to use a multiplier of 1.5x to up-weight their impact on the overall picture. The reason for that is due to the higher predictiveness of offense than defense. This 1.5x is what is used in the rbsdm tiers charts that you see floating around Twitter dot com.In the chart below, you can see how each teams stacks up by each of the statistics. (Remember that positive numbers always favor the offense, so lower numbers are better when looking at defenses.)The teams that were selected have at least a 10% chance of making the playoffs, per FiveThirtyEight.DVOA really loves Tampa Bay and also really hates Green Bay‚Äôs defense. When we chart the weighted totals for each stat, we can get a pretty clear picture of the contenders and pretenders.Teams above the line are relatively better by DVOA and teams below the line are relatively better by EPA/play. There‚Äôs really only one meaningful outlier and that is Tampa Bay, who is far better by DVOA than by EPA/play. This is largely fueled by their defense running well ahead of every other contender in the NFC. Tampa Bay has a really good defense, there is no doubt about that, but defense tends to be less stable over time, so we may see some regression there.The pretenders basket is very easy to find. Chicago, Washington, and Philadelphia are just not very good. All three have defenses that rank in the top 11 by DVOA, but all three offenses are bad. Minnesota may have dug themselves too big of a hole to come out of, but they look more like a fringy Wild Card contender than a bad team.The contender basket is pretty crowded. I‚Äôd say the top tier of teams is Tampa Bay, Los Angeles, and Green Bay. From there it is a small drop to the second tier of Seattle, Arizona, and New Orleans. The final tier of NFC contenders is San Francisco and Minnesota.There is very little separating the first two tiers though. We saw a second tier team annihilate a top tier team on Sunday. Two Sundays ago, a tier three team beat a tier one team. Football happens. Given that there are a relatively small number of possessions and NFL games are rarely decided by more than two scores, anything can happen on any given Sunday. What is clear to me from this analysis is that the NFC has no truly elite team. There is no Kansas City Chiefs in the NFC.The fact that there is a great deal of high-quality parity in the NFC makes the quest for the one-seed all the more vital. Using DVOA, the Packers have the 12th easiest schedule remaining in the NFL. The only contending teams in the NFC with easier schedules are Seattle and Washington. Seattle has some layups (Giants, Jets, and Washington), but also have to face the Rams twice, the Cardinals once, and the 49ers at the end of the season (likely after many of their players return). FiveThirtyEight actually gives the Packers the best odds of any NFC team to get the one-seed at 31%. Doing so will be vital as any advantage you can get in this crowded NFC field, and it may be the difference between a Super Bowl appearance and going home."

Without him on the field, the Packers will need to determine if Aaron Jones will act as the motion man, as he has in the past, or if another player is better suited to that role in this contest.Likewise, filling in on special teams will be a challenge for coordinator Shawn Mennenga. The team‚Äôs second option on returns, wide receiver Darrius Shepherd, is inactive for this game with an injury.

The Green Bay Packers elected not to activate the wide receiver from injured reserve on Saturday, meaning he will remain inactive as the team hosts the Jacksonville Jaguars. However, one Packer with a much longer history in Jacksonville will get his chance to beat his old team.The last time the Packers played the Jaguars, Blake Bortles started under center for the Jags. The last time the two teams met at Lambeau Field, Blaine Gabbert was the starter. Also, in both of those games, Marcedes Lewis was on the other sideline.This week, Lewis will play against his old team for the first time after leaving Jacksonville during the 2018 offseason. 12 years in Jacksonville came to an end at that time, and Lewis has been an important part of the Packers‚Äô offense since Matt LaFleur‚Äôs arrival, used heavily in the running game as a blocker as well as getting around a target per game through the air.The history between these two inter-conference teams is not long. The six games these teams have played have seen three two-game winning streaks, the first for the Packers, the second for the Jaguars, and then the last two for Green Bay again.

Is that enough?The last time the Green Bay Packers were favored by 13 points or more, they squeaked out an absurd comeback victory. In week 17 last season, the Packers came into Ford Field as 13.5-point favorites against the Detroit Lions, needing a win over a 3-11-1 team to clinch a first-round bye.Things did not go according to plan in the first half, as Aaron Rodgers missed on deep ball after deep ball and the Lions built a 17-3 lead. However, those passes started connecting in the second half, and the Packers staged a furious comeback, their second of the season against the Lions. At the end, the Packers got what they needed ‚Äî a victory ‚Äî but it came on a last-second field goal as the team barely eked out the win.This Sunday, the Packers are again nearly two-touchdown favorites, with a 13- or 13.5-point spread (depending on where you look) separating them from the 1-7 Jacksonville Jaguars. With the game coming at Lambeau Field, the Packers surely hope to win by a much more convincing margin than their three-point victory in that week 17 game a year ago.APC feels good about the Packers winning and beating the spread this week, however, as the team is 6-2 both overall and against the spread this season.

What should we expect?The Packers will face off with the Jaguars for the first time since 2016 on Sunday. The last time around, the Jaguars ended up being pretty solid on defense. This Sunday? Well, things could be a little different.To get a grasp on the Jaguars‚Äô defense, we checked in with Ryan O‚ÄôBleness of Big Cat Country. Yesterday, he gave us his perspective on the offense. Check out that conversation here.Acme Packing Company: I can‚Äôt help but notice that Josh Jones, a second-round pick for the Packers in 2017, is second on the team in tackles. What‚Äôs the story on Jones so far this year?Ryan O‚ÄôBleness: Jones impressed the coaching staff in training camp enough to trade away former third-round pick Ronnie Harrison. He is second on the team in total tackles with 61 and leads the team in solo tackles with 42 ‚Äî of course, it‚Äôs generally not a good sign when a safety is amongst the highest on the team in tackles. He hasn‚Äôt made a ton of impact plays, as he has not recorded an interception, sack or even a pass defended this season. According to Pro Football Reference, he‚Äôs also given up 20 receptions on 23 targets (87 percent) and two touchdowns, while giving up 13.7 yards per completion, and a quarterback rating of 145.1. So, those numbers don‚Äôt look great. Pro Football Focus grades him overall at a pretty pedestrian 52.5. There is definitely a lot of room for improvement with Jones, especially in coverage.APC: If you were Matt LaFleur, how would you attack the Jaguars defense?RO: The game plan should be pretty simple for the Packers because they‚Äôre the superior talented team. I don‚Äôt think there is anybody on Jacksonville who can matchup with Davante Adams, so definitely look to get him the ball early and often, and that usually seems to be the plan for Green Bay anyway. The Jaguars generally play a lot of cover-three zone, and fail to generate much of a pass rush, so Aaron Rodgers will likely have time to pick the zone apart while keeping his jersey mostly clean. Jacksonville has an extremely young defense that has been shredded by many quarterbacks this season, and is also putrid against the run. The unit ranks 31st in total yards allowed, 28th against the pass, 27th against the run and 31st in points allowed. The Jaguars also rank dead last in defensive DVOA. So, no need for LaFleur to overthink this one. Get the ball to Adams and Aaron Jones and know that your offensive skill players are going to out-match just about anybody on Jacksonville‚Äôs defense. I expect the Packers, offensively, to have an absolute field day on Sunday.APC: Josh Allen and C.J. Henderson make it two top-10 picks on defense for the Jaguars in the past two years. How strong is the foundation? Do you have hope for the future?RO: Allen, who was voted team captain in just his second season, had a breakout rookie year, but similar to Chark, he has dealt with some injuries and inconsistency in 2020. He does lead the team in sacks, but it‚Äôs only with 2.5, which goes to show how awful Jacksonville‚Äôs pass rush has been this season. He‚Äôs also generated 39 quarterback pressures and 10 quarterback hits. I think he gets more attention from defenses now, as well. All of that said, I think the future is still very bright for him. Allen needs others around him to generate more pressure and take some of the focus off of him, but I still have plenty of faith in Allen.Henderson had a great debut in Week One against the Colts, earning Rookie of the Week honors following his strong performance. But since then, his play has been up and down and he‚Äôs been burned a few times. So far this season, he‚Äôs given up 29 receptions on 45 targets (64.4 percent) for 400 yards, three touchdowns, 13.8 yards per completion and a quarterback rating of 105.8. He has recorded five pass deflections and an interception. I think growing pains are expected for rookies, especially, at the cornerback position, so there is no reason to worry just yet. Henderson will be fine, but has a lot of room for growth.The foundation is there for the future with a lot of young talent on both sides of the ball, a ton of salary cap space, and a plethora of early draft picks, but the defense likely isn‚Äôt going to improve anytime soon as long as defensive Todd Wash is still running the show on that side of the ball.APC: What‚Äôs your prediction for Sunday?RO: The Packers win by roughly 100 points. Just kidding, but I would be surprised if the Jaguars keep it within 20. I‚Äôll say something along the lines of 41-17, Packers."

Aaron Jones was also listed as a full participant on the Packers‚Äô Thursday injury report, painting an optimistic picture for the Packers overall.Bakhtiari hasn‚Äôt played since Week 6, when he left the Packers‚Äô 38-10 loss to the Buccaneers early. That was also the last time Jones was on the field before his return last Thursday against the 49ers, and having both back would be a significant boost to the offense, though that unit has played fairly well in their absence overall.In less positive news, Jaire Alexander continues to recover from his concussion and did not participate in practice today, leaving his status in serious doubt for Sunday.Tight end Robert Tonyan, meanwhile, was a new addition to the injury report, popping up as a limited participant with a knee injury. Tight end John Lovett was also listed as a limited participant today after participating fully on Wednesday.Defensive backs Kevin King, Will Redmond, and Vernon Scott were all limited participants as well, as were wide receiver Equanimeous St. Brown and tackle Rick Wagner.Tight end Marcedes Lewis and wide receiver Darrius Shepherd were listed non-participants, battling knee and shoulder injuries respectively."

The same cannot be said for the defense, however, particularly in the secondary, where the team‚Äôs two starting cornerbacks are still in question for Sunday‚Äôs game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.Jaire Alexander, who suffered a concussion last week in San Francisco, has been ruled doubtful for Sunday‚Äôs game. Alexander remains in the concussion protocol, but he did take the first step towards returning to game action by practicing on a limited basis Friday after sitting out the week‚Äôs earlier practices. Joining him on the injury report is his partner on the opposite side of the field, Kevin King, who has missed the Packers‚Äô last four games with a quad injury. King practiced on a limited basis all week and is listed as questionable for the game.Also questionable are two of the Packers‚Äô reserve safeties, Will Redmond and Vernon Scott. Both of these two players have shoulder injuries and, like King, both were limited participants all week long. The Packers have elevated safety Henry Black from the practice squad in each of the past three weeks, a move only allowed because Black was designated as an emergency COVID-19 elevation a week ago. If he is to play on Sunday, he will likely need to be given a full promotion to the 53-man roster.On offense, however, things are looking up. David Bakhtiari was a full participant all week in practice, and he should make his return at left tackle after missing three games. Running back Aaron Jones and Tyler Ervin, meanwhile, appear have had no setbacks after they returned to the field in San Francisco last Thursday. Both of them were also full participants all week and carry no injury status for the game.The one concerning injury for the Packers‚Äô offense is to starting tight end Robert Tonyan, who popped up on the injury report Thursday with an ankle injury. He did not practice on Friday and is listed as questionable.The Packers‚Äô opponents, however, cannot say the same for their offense. Starting quarterback Gardner Minshew is indeed out for Sunday, and he will be joined by wide receiver Laviska Shenault. The rookie receiver practiced on a limited basis earlier in the week, but he was a non-participant on Friday and will join Minshew on the inactive list along with reserve running back Devine Ozigbo, linebacker Dakota Allen, and defensive tackle Doug Costin. One Packers connection on the Jaguars roster, former Green Bay safety Josh Jones, is questionable with a chest issue."

Tied for the top seed in the NFC, the Packers get an opportunity at home to sustain their success against a Jaguar team that finds itself second from the bottom of the AFC standings.How each team got to this place has plenty to do with quarterback play. The Packers have benefited from two decades of legendary passers and are in the midst of developing another high-quality quarterback to continue that success. Jacksonville, meanwhile, is hoping for another shot at landing that type of player at the conclusion of this season.Today‚Äôs musings take a look at the skill positions, but begin with the wide difference in strategy and success between the two teams under center.The Jaguars‚Äô quarterback struggle this season is a further reminder of the value of both identifying and securing a top-end signal caller. Many Packers fans, this author included, criticized the team for drafting Jordan Love in the first round this year only to be a week-to-week inactive. But if Green Bay is correct in its evaluation of Love and he becomes a top-10 level of talent down the line, the Packers will look like geniuses for trading up up to grab him in the mid-20s.As General Manager Brian Gutekunst said in April, the Packers selected the best value on the board and that strategy, especially at quarterback, has left Gutekunst in an enviable position. ‚ÄúWe looked at it like we really do every year,‚Äù said Gutekunst after the draft. ‚ÄúWe evaluate all the players and certainly quarterback is of the highest priority for an NFL franchise. We evaluate those guys very closely. And you set your boards. Again, you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôll happen. But I‚Äôve never in my time in Green Bay, we‚Äôve never been in a spot where it was like, ‚ÄòHey, we have to go get a quarterback this year.‚ÄôJacksonville has not been lucky in identifying quarterback talent in the first round over the past decade. From Blaine Gabbert in 2011 with the 10th pick to Blake Bortles in 2014 at number three overall, the Jaguars have not hit on their top quarterback prospects. Jacksonville could have also taken Lamar Jackson with the 29th overall pick back in 2018, but instead picked Taven Bryan and watched Jackson bloom into a future star at the end of the first round. Bortles, of course, had his best season as a pro during the 2017 season, but quickly tailed off. Even in 2020, Jacksonville passed on Love while narrowly missing out on the crop of talent a few picks earlier. Opting to go with sixth-round picks over the past two years in Gardner Minshew and Jake Luton, the Jaguars have found themselves in a familiar place once again despite making an AFC Championship appearance just three seasons ago.With a 1-7 record, the Jaguars are currently in prime position to land an elite quarterback in the upcoming draft, such as Justin Fields or Trevor Lawrence, and that could very well be the dawn of a new age for the franchise. But as Luton makes the start this weekend, Jacksonville‚Äôs inconsistencies are a reminder of the reward for patience, planning, and execution at finding and developing a quarterback, even if it does not pay immediate dividends.It is far too early to tell what kind of impact AJ Dillon will make for the Packers in the near future at running back. After all, he has only been used sparingly in the first eight games. But using second-round draft capital for a running back in today‚Äôs NFL is a fairly high price and a topic well-discussed on blogs such as APC.In Sunday‚Äôs meeting between Green Bay and Jacksonville, the question of running back value again comes back into play. The Packers are led in carries by a former fifth-round pick in Aaron Jones and a fourth-rounder in Jamaal Williams. Jones, in particular, has been a game-changer when healthy as both a receiver and runner. He‚Äôs been one of many solid running backs to come out of the 2017 draft class and in many ways outperformed the backs taken on the first two days of the draft.On the other sideline is a rookie undrafted free agent who finds himself sixth in the league in rushing yards. Illinois State‚Äôs James Robinson has accumulated 580 rushing yards and 225 receiving yards in eight games for the Jags, setting an undrafted rookie record for most yards from scrimmage in the first nine weeks. After using the fourth overall pick on Leonard Fournette in 2017, Jacksonville has received just as much value from a non-drafted rookie.While it will be the Packer defense‚Äôs responsibility to slow down Robinson on Sunday, the rushing leaders for both teams point out gems that can be found outside the top rounds on a consistent basis.The success of Davante Adams this season has helped cover up some severe inconsistencies from the Packers‚Äô receiving corps. Not drafting a wide receiver in the first round has been covered in-depth, as has the team‚Äôs decision not to trade for a pass-catcher prior to the deadline. However, one player rarely covered since the summer is Funchess, the one player the Packers did add to their group of receivers.As a possession receiver without top-end speed, Funchess was not going to be a vertical threat for the Packers this season before opting out due to COVID. But he may have been the type of steady, reliable target Green Bay has lacked more than anything. The drops from Equanimeous St. Brown against Minnesota and Marquez Valdes-Scantling versus San Francisco have hurt the Packers‚Äô offense on key downs and also held Aaron Rodgers back from having some of the decisiveness he showed earlier in the season. While Funchess‚Äôs NFL experience opposite Adams could have improved that trust a little bit, Funchess has had his own drop issues with a total of 20 over four seasons.Green Bay clearly likes length in its receivers and Funchess fit that bill ‚Äî perhaps too much so ‚Äî with the other receivers on the roster when originally signed. But the void left by the injury to Allen Lazard, a comparable athlete, could have been filled more easily by Funchess than Malik Taylor and the crew listed above. Without on-field action or chemistry with Rodgers to analyze, it is hard to gauge the impact Funchess would have made on the receiving game this season. But losing him before the season started may have been just as big of a blow to the receiving corps as any failed opportunity to make an addition."
17,packers,https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/2020/10/19/21524376/all-good-things-must-come-to-an-end#comments,All good things must come to an end.,"Acme Packing Company, a Green Bay Packers communityBy Dog Eggs on Oct 19, 2020, 9:58pm CDT +On Sunday afternoon, the Packers winstreak entire season came to an end.
This is an obvious overreaction... or is it?The Packers were slated to take on the Buccs in Tampa, in what appeared to be a more interesting 'Battle of the Bays' than usual of late. The Buccs on paper are potentially an elite team, with GOAT qb, elite receivers, the best TE in history (or what's left of him), and an up and coming defense filled with young talent, and an abundance of size and speed. Meanwhile, the Packers were undefeated, led by a HoF qb of their own, a couple of weapons who aren't too badly injured to play, and an explosive running game keeping defenses guessing against the run and the pass. The also technically have a defense too, though that unit has not yet taken the field this season. Fortunately, the offense has been so efficient, they outscore everyone even without the help of a defense.The game started with nothing too surprising, as the Packers found themselves with a 10-0 lead, which very easily could have been 14-0.Then just as quickly as it started, the Packers were for the first time all season punched back by an opponent, as the Buccs pressured Rodgers and he threw a pick-6. At this point, still with the lead technically, the game was already over. The entire Packers team realized this team was going to fight back, and they revealed they were not about to fight back, or even pretend to try. The defense folded like paper, which in fairness, they have done all season; but this time even worse than usual, marked by not just bad play, but completely uninspired lack of effort. No big hits, questionable calls, mistakes in coverage, or any of the usual things which can be corrected with coaching. None of that, they just wanted no part of this, and looked eager to get the game over with so they could complain in the postgame interviews.THIS IS STILL THE 2ND QUARTER, IN A CLOSE GAME!!!Anyways, the defense had already started waving the white flag, but at least we had an explosive offense to keep us in it... Except, Rodgers looked more interested in talking to Suh, than attempting to mount a comeback. He threw another pick on the very next drive.The defense continued to fold, and rather than blitzing or going for the big hit, or changing things up, or anything, they simply curled up and died. There was no pressure on Brady, and worse, there was no attempt to put pressure on Brady. The defense refused to try to make tackles against the run game, looked disinterested against the pass, and nobody stood out trying to beat their blocks or win their one-on-ones. It was truly pathetic, and that is an understatement.Meanwhile, this explosive offense followed their game script. They refused to attempt any difficult throws to try to take back momentum, the blocking was done with minimal effort and zero enthusiasm, and the run game lost its attitude. Rodgers remained more interested in making excuses to Suh between plays, than actually completing any passes; and we had ourselves a punt-fest on one side of the ball.By the end of the half, the offense and the defense had both waived the white flag, and the coach for whatever reason kept them out there. Honestly, the results may have looked worse on the scoreboard, but you would have at least seen more fight out of a college defense. At least they would play with a little effort to try not to get embarrassed.Anyways, the Packers never even came close to scoring another point for the rest of the game; and meanwhile the defense had players standing around with hands on their hips, watching as their teammates get run over. This culminated in a a massive blowout victory for the Buccs.Blowouts happen, they are part of sports. It is a make or miss league. Oftentimes games are determined by an extra yard here or there, or an extra inch being all that separates a huge play for the offense from a deflection. But that was not the case here. This team had the lead and had already visibly given up. They had no desire to fight back. I am a lifelong Packers fan, and what I saw was absolutely depressing and downright inexcusable. These multi-millionaires are paid to play a game for a living, and they looked like they were on strike, just because the other team decided to play back this time. This is the kind of losing culture we have come to expect from the Browns; but not the former undefeated Packers. We watched an entire team just surrender in the first half. And a coaching staff who not only played it safe by refusing to try to change it up with anything risky; but more importantly refused to bench these ""professional"" athletes for standing around with their hands on their hips.I love MLF's system and feel he was building us to be like the 49ers of last season, except with a HoF QB. But I was forced to realize in just one game, that this team is a pretender, not a contender. They will gladly beat up on the little guys, and walk into the playoffs. But the moment they get punched in the mouth, they just tuck their tails between their legs and cower in the fetal position. On paper this team can win a Super Bowl. But any team that stands around and watches their teammates get trucked into the endzone, with players who don't even try to get involved in delivering a hit; has zero chance of winning the big one. MLF lost a lot of my respect when he kept these players in the game. I know the backups aren't going to win us the game; but at least they would have played with a lot more effort than the starters did. That to me is inexcusable and embarrassing to the game of football.This team lost its will to fight. I don't know why they did, but I do know that is difficult to fix. We can probably walk into the playoffs these next few years; but I would prefer to just blow it up now. Generally I believe teams choose to blow it up too soon, and any team in the playoffs has a chance. But not these quitters. Sorry to be so doom and gloom. Just saying, I have played, watched, and coached a lot of football over the years; and I have never seen a team with no will to fight accomplish anything great.Hope they prove me wrong, but sadly I know they won't.FanPosts are designed to be used to start a conversation on a specific topic, not unlike a front page story.

That was Hackett.The Jacksonville Jaguars, who travel to play the Packers at Lambeau Field Sunday, famously let Hackett go midway through the 2018 season and LaFleur wasted little time in adding him to his staff when the Packers hired him.Freed of the albatross that was Blake Bortles, Hackett has proven given the right tools he can cook up a sizzling offense. It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see him mentioned as a head coach candidate come the offseason.It‚Äôd be a loss for Green Bay, but he would represent the first branch of the LaFleur coaching tree.There‚Äôs more on Hackett plus an early look at next week‚Äôs Packers opponent in today‚Äôs curds.Packers‚Äô Aaron Rodgers: ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs nobody in the building that brings me more joy‚Äô than Nathaniel Hackett‚ÄîWisconsin State JournalThe focus has been on the Aaron Rodgers/Matt LaFleur dynamic but the quarterback seems absolutely head over heels in love with the offensive coordinator. Rodgers mentioned how big of a role Hackett has made in the cultural refresh the team has made under LaFleur and how he doesn‚Äôt want Hackett to go anywhere (unless, Rodgers said with a smirk, he goes somewhere else before the coach).Behind the scenes, Nathaniel Hackett has been integral part of Packers‚Äô offensive success‚ÄîPackers.comFor his part, LaFleur has called Hackett the ‚Äúglue guy‚Äù that brings everything together for the offense.

19,packers,https://www.acmepackingcompany.com/2020/11/11/21561292/packers-appear-to-have-signed-running-back-mike-weber-likely-to-practice-squad,"Packers appear to have signed running back Mike Weber, likely to practice squad","FILED UNDER:With Dexter Williams injured and AJ Dillon still sidelined due to COVID, the Packers have their new emergency tailback.With two of the team‚Äôs running backs unavailable for the immediate future, the Green Bay Packers have brought in a new player to help the depth at tailback for the time being. AJ Dillon remains on the reserve/COVID-19 list and Dexter Williams appears headed to injured reserve with an MCL sprain, so the Packers have evidently signed Mike Weber to serve as an emergency option.Weber was present and practicing with the Packers on Wednesday as the team continued its preparations for Sunday‚Äôs game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. With the team now having three running backs available, it is unlikely that Weber will need to be elevated for the upcoming game, but with Williams likely out for a few weeks, he could see emergency duty should one of Aaron Jones, Jamaal Williams, or Tyler Ervin need to miss time.The Dallas Cowboys drafted Weber in the seventh round of the 2019 NFL Draft, but he did not make the team out of training camp and spent the entirety of his rookie season on Dallas‚Äô practice squad. He spent a portion of the 2020 offseason with the Kansas City Chiefs, but was released in early May and has been a free agent since.At Ohio State, Weber had a solid three-year playing career before leaving for the draft after his redshirt junior season. In 2016, Weber gained 1,096 rushing yards on 182 carries ‚Äî a six-yard average ‚Äî as the team‚Äôs primary running back. He then split time with JK Dobbins as a sophomore and a junior, seeing his workload decrease a bit. Weber was often used as a receiver out of the backfield, catching 54 passes in three seasons. However, Weber was primarily used as a check-down option. At the 2019 NFL Combine, Weber measured in just under 5-foot-10 and at 211 pounds and posted a very solid time in the 40-yard dash at 4.47 seconds.UPDATE: The Packers made the Weber signing official on Wednesday afternoon, indeed signing him to the practice squad. They did move Dexter Williams to the practice squad/injured list as well to open up the spot for Weber."

The team announced the news this afternoon.Barnes has reportedly tested positive for the virus. His positive test came to light earlier today, a result of pre-game testing ahead of the Packers‚Äô Thursday Night Football game with the San Francisco 49ers.An undrafted free agent out of UCLA, Barnes has appeared in every game so far this season, starting seven. He currently leads the Packers in tackles.Love is Barnes‚Äô roommate and presumably is considered a high-risk close contact at this point. There‚Äôs been no word so far of any positive test for the rookie quarterback, who has yet to be active for a game this year.The Packers currently have five players on the COVID-19 reserve list; in addition to Love and Barnes, linebacker Kamal Martin and running backs A.J. Dillon and Jamaal Williams are all on the list. So far, Barnes and Dillon are the only known positive tests.However, given that the Packers have what amounts to a mini-bye after their Thursday win over the 49ers, there‚Äôs a good chance all of these players could be available for the Packers‚Äô Week 10 game against the Jaguars."

They‚Äôve already touched base with the Falcons, Buccaneers, and Texans, all relatively uncommon opponents. Next on their list are the Jacksonville Jaguars, whom the Packers last saw in Week 1 of the 2016 season.To get up to speed on the Jaguars, we touched base with Ryan O‚ÄôBleness of Big Cat Country. Today, he‚Äôll give us a look at Jacksonville‚Äôs offense. He‚Äôll be back tomorrow with a look at the defense.Acme Packing Company: Jake Luton is poised to start at quarterback for the Jaguars, but he‚Äôs hardly a household name. What should we know about the rookie?Ryan O‚ÄôBleness: Jake Luton is a sixth-round pick (just like Gardner Minshew was last year) out of Oregon State, and played at Idaho prior to that. He‚Äôs a big quarterback at 6-feet-6-inches tall and about 225 pounds. With Minshew suffering a hand injury and unable to play, Luton got thrown right into the fire against the Houston Texans, getting the starting nod over veteran Mike Glennon ‚Äî Luton had been inactive for every game prior to that. He has a strong arm, in fact his second throw of the game against Houston went for a 73-yard touchdown to D.J. Chark:6 goes for 6 @JakeLuton6 connects with @DJChark82 for a 73-yard TD on his first career pass. pic.twitter.com/F53Vr9VveWHe fared pretty well in his debut, outside of an interception and fumble (that was recovered by the Jaguars) and a couple of other minor things here and there. All things considered, it probably went better than most Jaguars fans expected, as he completed 68.4 percent of his passes for 304 yards and one touchdown, with the one pick. But obviously, the sample size is small. In college, he was known for having a big arm and protecting the football (just three interceptions his senior year compared to 28 touchdown passes). Now that there is at least some professional film on him, he may not catch the Packers by surprise, which was possible against the Texans. But, as you reminded me, Jon, the Packers have been susceptible on defense to giving up career days to certain players, so who knows. There is definitely potential with Luton, but at the end of the day, he‚Äôs still an unpolished sixth-round rookie.He also showed some moxie on a late-game touchdown run, complete with a stiff arm and spin move, that nearly tied the game for the Jaguars, but the two-point conversion was missed and the Jaguars lost yet againThat spin move @JakeLuton6 runs it in for the TD!
: CBS | #DUUUVAL pic.twitter.com/AAn0j3fI67APC: It was a moderate surprise (at the very least) when Leonard Fournette found himself on the outs in Jacksonville, but James Robinson has been solid as the feature back for the Jaguars. What‚Äôs been your impression?RO: Yes, at the time, that decision seemed like a strange one for the Jaguars. Fournette didn‚Äôt have the best start to his career with the Jaguars, and his personality didn‚Äôt seem to mesh well with the front office or coaches, but surely he was going to be one of the best offensive weapons on this extremely young team for one more season, right? Well, it didn‚Äôt take long for James Robinson to prove why that decision was made. He was a gem of a find by Jacksonville, as an undrafted free agent out of Illinois State. Right away, Robinson made his presence felt with 62 rushing yards and 28 receiving yards in an opening week win (and Jacksonville‚Äôs only win thus far) against the Indianapolis Colts.Since then, Robinson has gone on to set the single season record for yards from scrimmage by an undrafted free agent (805 yards), formerly held by Phillip Lindsay of the Denver Broncos. Robinson averages 4.4 yards per carry, and has also scored seven total touchdowns already (Fournette only had three in all of 2019). He can run between the tackles, beat you with speed to the edge, catch the ball out of the backfield, hurdle you or run you over. He is a quiet guy that lets his play do the talking. I have been very impressed with Robinson, and he looks like the bell cow back of the future for the Jags.APC: Between D.J. Chark and Laviska Shenault, the Jaguars have a pair of interesting young pass catchers. How dangerous can they be?RO: Chark had a breakout year in 2019, but has been inconsistent so far in 2020, and has dealt with some injuries. He finally broke free last week against the Texans, catching seven passes for 146 yards and the aforementioned 73-yard touchdown, proving that he is still a key weapon in the passing game. Chark possesses the coveted combination of size and speed that makes him hard to defend, and somebody who defenses have to pay attention to. When Chark is healthy, he is one of the best young receivers in the game. He just has to put together strong performances on a more consistent basis, but he is definitely somebody who will look to make an impact on Sunday.Similar to Robinson, Shenault is another rookie the Jaguars have relied on. He left the game last week with a hamstring injury, but is practicing this week. Shenault is a dynamic player who the Jaguars will line up all over the field ‚Äî split out wide, in the slot, as a running back and even as a wildcat quarterback. The Jaguars want to get the ball in his hands however they can because he is tough to bring down and can make things happen after the catch. If he is healthy, you‚Äôll likely hear his name called a lot this weekend.Stay tuned for part 2 coming tomorrow!"

As a result, we‚Äôve got an Adams-focused shirt that celebrates his love of finding the end zone:Meanwhile, Aaron Jones has been running rampant since the start of 2019, and after a career game in week two, he now leads the NFL in rushing yards, yards from scrimmage, and total touchdowns scored.This year, Jones has really started to let his personality show. From the sombrero he has been donning in the offseason to his newest fashion accessory ‚Äî his touchdown glasses ‚Äî Jones has a fun style all his own. We‚Äôre celebrating that style and one of his nicknames with a cheesy take on Jones‚Äô choices of accessories.A quick reminder on BreakingT‚Äôs shirts ‚Äî they run a bit snug, so if you‚Äôre unsure about the size, pick the larger of the two.As is the case with all APC t-shirts, we donate all of our proceeds to charity. For these two shirts (and the DVOA shirt as well), we‚Äôre donating the funds to the National Math + Science Initiative, which promotes STEM education, particularly for underserved populations."

He traveled to San Francisco which gave some fans hope he would play, but he still has yet to be activated from injured reserve.Getting Lazard back is going to give the offense a huge jolt, something perhaps some forgot in banging the drum for Texans receiver Will Fuller (who would have for sure been an upgrade over Marquez Valdes-Scantling, but don‚Äôt sell Lazard short).The offense is getting healthy at the right time for a second half push for the NFC‚Äôs top seed and lone bye thanks to the new playoff format so fans should buckle up.

From tight end to fullback to H-back, the Packers viewed Deguara as a tool capable of pitching in at multiple positions. But when he suffered an injury early in the season and was later lost for the year with a torn ACL, the team turned to former Princeton quarterback John Lovett to fill one of those roles in particular: fullback.Now, it appears that the team will need to find yet another option as a lead blocker. According to ESPN‚Äôs Adam Schefter, Lovett has a torn ACL and will be out for the rest of the season. It appears likely that Lovett suffered the injury in practice on Thursday; he was listed as a full participant on Wednesday but was limited on Thursday‚Äôs report.Lovett has played in all eight games this season for the Packers after starting the season on the practice squad. In the first two contests, Lovett was elevated to the active roster for gameday, but he was brought up fully onto the 53-man roster for week three. He has played just 45 snaps on offense, most as a lead blocker, though he did get three carries in garbage time against the San Francisco 49ers last Thursday. The other area where Lovett has contributed heavily is on special teams, as he has been on the field for more than half of the team‚Äôs special teams snaps this season.The Packers will likely place Lovett on injured reserve before this weekend‚Äôs game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. While the team only uses a fullback on a handful of snaps in each game, Jace Sternberger could be a candidate to line up there moving forward. Another option would be for the Packers to elevate or promote another tight end/fullback from the practice squad, where Dax Raymond and Dominique Dafney both currently reside.Lovett will now end both of his two NFL seasons on injured reserve. He missed all of 2019 on the Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô IR list after suffering a shoulder injury in training camp."

Two touchdowns from Aaron Rodgers ‚Äî one on a deep pass and one a short run ‚Äî have the Packers sitting with a 17-10 lead at the break.The first quarter was a lesson in frustration, however. The Packers went three-and-out on their opening drive and again on their third, and a 52-yard Jaguars field goal had the Packers trailing heading into the second quarter. But on the first snap of that period, Rodgers found Marquez Valdes-Scantling with a deep ball and MVS rumbled into the end zone for a 78-yard touchdown.The Packers would give the lead back a few minutes later, however, when JK Scott‚Äôs booming punt outkicked his coverage. Keelan Cole found a seam and took the return 90 yards for a touchdown, making Scott look foolish on his tackle attempt down the field. But Rodgers struck back with the help of Davante Adams and Jamaal Williams, who helped him move the football down the field. On second and goal from the five-yard line, Rodgers rolled right off a play-fake and scampered into the end zone for a 14-10 Packers lead.Green Bay got a chance to extend their lead late in the half further, as Adrian Amos picked off Jake Luton and returned the ball to the 30-yard line. Rodgers should have had a touchdown to Davante Adams, but a holding penalty on Billy Turner wiped away the score. Instead, Mason Crosby came on to hit a 39-yard field goal at the end of the half to bring the lead up to seven points.Rodgers has had a very efficient half after the offense‚Äôs early struggles, completing 16 of 20 passes for 200 yards and the touchdown to MVS.

The most ironic part of the injuries that have taken place is that it has effected those players who are FA next year (Bahk, Aaron Jones, Kevin King). This has forced the offensive line to shuffle and allowed Lucas Patrick and Jon Runyan to play meaningful snaps and they performed well. Allowed Josh Jackson to exercise some 2nd round bust demons and play well in Kings absence (so far). Lastly, it's given Jamal Williams some 1st team opportunity and be a workhorse with Dillon backing him up.This begs the question, should the Pack focus on resigning these players given the performance of their backups or should they focus their cap resources elsewhere, improving other areas of the team (i.e. WR, Dline)?

5 GUYS COVERING THE SAME EXACT LANE

They should look like a net.. ‚ÄúLane integrity‚Äù pic.twitter.com/1Dx3CDSms8That win goes under the umbrella of ‚Äúleast enjoyable wins in my lifetime‚Äù alongside last year‚Äôs win over Washington. It was gross and ugly and the weather sucked and the team played like crap and in the end they snuck out with what they came for.I do hate the back-patting that went on after the game amongst much of the Packers online community. This was a very bad Jacksonville team. The Packers are, by pretty much all measures, a good team. There was no reason for this game to be all that close. Jacksonville didn‚Äôt play well. Their quarterback was atrocious and their running game, while annoying, wasn‚Äôt effective enough to build an offense around. The Packers offense though couldn‚Äôt get out of its own way. Drops, a fumble, an interception, penalties, and an absolute disasterclass from Matt LaFleur all made this a lot more difficult than it needed to be. I want to focus on that last part because it actually sets up a lot of what happened.I want to acknowledge the weather on Sunday before diving into the playcalling choices. The weather sucked. It was windy and cold and also not that weird for Green Bay as we move into late fall. While it did put some limits on what you could do offensively, Green Bay was actually pretty successful throwing down the field. In fact, Green Bay was generally fine throwing the ball basically anywhere beyond the line of scrimmage. Rodgers had .26 EPA/dropback against JAX, which would rank him 5th in the NFL this season. If you take out his interception (which I realize is cherry-picking), he would be at .36 EPA/dropback which puts him in line with his MVP-esque season numbers. The Packers could throw the ball just fine. The weather was not a real impediment.The game plan against Jacksonville should have been incredibly straight forward. By both EPA/play and DVOA, Jacksonville had the worst pass defense in the NFL through nine weeks. Their rush defense was more average, ranking 16th and 21st in EPA/play and DVOA, respectively. The Packers passing offense ranked 2nd in passing EPA/play and 3rd in passing DVOA. This is a match made in heaven for the Packers offense. Come out and throw the ball, and rack up points like it‚Äôs 2011.Instead, we got a Green Bay offense that ran on 44.4% of its early downs. They averaged -0.2 EPA/play on those runs and a 30% success rate. That is worse than a New York Jets pass play and equivalent to the NFL-worst Texans rushing offense. When they did pass on early downs, they were incredibly successful, racking up 0.42 EPA/play and a 52% success rate. On 1st and 10, Green Bay ran on 42% of their plays and averaged a mere TWO yards per carry.The Packers were particularly guilty of the disaster of 2nd and long runs. The Packers ran on 2nd and 7+ five times for an average of -0.18 EPA/play. A lot Green Bay‚Äôs warts in this game were kind of fluky. This issue is not. Green Bay has the second-highest run rate on 2nd and 7+ of any team in the NFL this year at 43%. They average a league-worst 3.1 yards per carry on those runs and a league-worst 28% success rate. Green Bay is wasting its time and wasting plays with these runs. Almost every second and long should be a pass regardless of context, but especially when Green Bay has been so spectacularly bad at running in those situations. This is LaFleur saddling his offense with an unnecessary burden. They don‚Äôt need to do this and it‚Äôs getting in the way of an elite offense.This problem has actually become worse as the season has gone on. Through the first month, Green Bay had the 3rd-highest early-down passing rate in the league. They rank 16th since week 6. It‚Äôs not like the passing game has become substantially worse. They ranked 1st in the league through the first five weeks, and since week 7 rank 3rd. The Tampa Bay game is an obvious damper on their overall stats, but the passing game has remained very efficient, even without efficiency-god Allen Lazard. If LaFleur stops getting in the way of the offense with so many run calls, there‚Äôs no reason to expect the offense not to get kicking into high gear again.Another pet peeve of mine is the RPO smoke/bubble plays. The terminology is different depending on your offense, but the smoke plays are the ones where the receiver doesn‚Äôt run any type of route and the quarterback just throws them the ball at the snap. I hate these plays. I hate them particularly because Davante Adams is often the target of them. It‚Äôs such a waste of Davante‚Äôs skills. He is not a YAC guy. In his career he has hovered around average in terms of his YACOE (yards after catch over expectation) from NextGenStats. What Davante is truly elite at is route running. So why would you give him the ball before he could run a route to do something he is merely average at? It‚Äôs like asking Devin Williams to pitch without his change-up or Giannis to only shoot jump shots. It‚Äôs silly.On these RPO passes against Jacksonville, Green Bay was pretty terrible. They averaged -0.34 EPA/play on them. This actually masks how bad they were on most of them. The one successful play was to MVS when Jacksonville had no one near him.If you take out this play, which is obviously a great check, Green Bay averaged -0.73 EPA/play on their other RPO bubble screen/smoke plays. Now this isn‚Äôt picking on all RPOs. Slants, swings to running backs, or major numerical advantages like the one above are perfectly fine and are useful parts of the offense. Sending targets out to die is just a waste of a play.Then there are issues that I put under the miscellaneous game management category. Late in the fourth quarter and only needing a single yard, Green Bay did the dumb thing that most teams do: put a bunch of bodies near the point of attack and run a running back directly into a pile of bodies.The Packers pile bodies into a nine-vs-nine in the A-gap and predictably get stuffed. There are several alternatives to this that could be much more useful. First is the QB Sneak, which has an elite success rate across the NFL (depending on the QB, between 70 and 90 percent). You could spread Jacksonville out and create more space for your RB. You could run an RPO to get a slight numbers advantage (you only need a yard). There‚Äôs a lot you can do. Stuffing up bodies in the way of your guy with the ball when you haven‚Äôt been able to run it all day seems like a foolish decision.Then there was the punt decision in the middle of the first quarter that only slightly annoyed me. In the grand scheme of the game, it was a minor error, but slightly annoying.---> JAX (3) @ GB (0) <---
GB has 4th & 7 at the JAX 42

Recommendation (MEDIUM): Go for it (+2.1 WP)
Actual play: J.Scott punts 37 yards to JAX 5, Center-H.Bradley, downed by https://t.co/vg0zhdxk52. pic.twitter.com/N0mLUNPNmuThis game overall was a disaster for LaFleur and probably the worst coached game of his career. These stinkers are not unheard of, though, as the team has had foolish game plans before. They got waxed by the Chargers and the 49ers twice last year with offensive game plans that did not fit the opponent. It‚Äôs not like you are required by law to run against a team that has a bad pass defense. Just look at what Buffalo did to Seattle last weekend:I hope LaFleur can take a page from Buffalo‚Äôs playbook and lean into this elite passing attack, even if it means abandoning his cherished running game. There are no bonus points for running the football. There is no extra valor. There is only setting your quarterback up in a more difficult spot on third down."

Green Bay shares that crucial position for the first-round bye with the New Orleans Saints, who defeated San Francisco despite losing Drew Brees to injury. Although the Packers‚Äô head-scratching offensive performance at times versus the Jaguars was not in the mold of a number one seeded team, the defense pulled its weight and prevented a final touchdown drive as part of a more lucky Green Bay win this season.Luck was on the Lions‚Äô side in Detroit this past weekend as well, as a crucial Washington penalty and Matt Prater‚Äôs 59-yard field goal lifted the team to a season-saving win at this point in the season. But Chicago suffered an unlucky loss with Nick Foles carted off the field on Monday evening, giving the Bears plenty to think about at the quarterback position heading into their bye week.Today‚Äôs rundown dives into those topics, while also exploring the way Minnesota is quickly becoming a playoff contender yet again.With Offensive Coordinator Bill Lazor calling the plays, the Bears accounted for just 149 yards of offense in another embarrassing loss.An apparent hip or leg injury removed Foles from the game and his status for the Bears‚Äô next game against Green Bay is in jeopardy.ESPN‚Äôs Jeff Dickerson dives into the salary cap restrictions that might be in play for Chicago to extend Robinson and how the star receiver stacks up against one notable receiver that was recently signed to a long-term deal.The Lions‚Äô kicker had a big afternoon on Sunday, knocking home a 53-yard field goal in the first half before winning the game from 59 yards out.A pair of defensive penalties almost cost Detroit the game. Fortunately for the Lions, Washington had a painful defensive penalty of its own in the waning seconds of the game.Detroit‚Äôs franchise quarterback moved up to 17th on the all-time list, surpassing a legend.Kirk Cousins earned his first win on Monday Night Football, snapping a nine-game winless streak, while Minnesota showed more emphasis on the passing game with Dalvin Cook held relatively in check.Without some of their key defensive pieces, the Vikings have altered their game plan schematically in a few different ways to prevent deep passes and boost the pass rush.That new defensive approach, combined with emerging offensive weapons and an NFC playoff field in flux, have opened the door for Minnesota to make a postseason run."

The Packers trailed the Jacksonville Jaguars 3-0 at the end of the first quarter, dealing with windy, chilly conditions and going into that wind in the first period.But after some poor execution early on, the first play of the second quarter saw everything change. With the Packers suddenly having the wind in their favor, Aaron Rodgers dialed up a deep ball with multiple receivers streaking deep. With the Jaguars‚Äô secondary focused on Davante Adams up the left side of the field, Marquez Valdes-Scantling was matched up one-on-one with Sidney Jones on the right side and ran a go route.Rodgers‚Äô throw was right on the money as MVS beat Jones off the line. After a double-clutch on the catch, MVS hauled in the pass and was off to the races. He got a little help from the back judge as he cut back across the field, and scampered into the end zone for a 78-yard touchdown.MVS even broke the ref‚Äôs ankles on this TD catch and run
pic.twitter.com/Yp3kyQ9y1UThe score put the Packers up 7-3, and their defense got a stop on the ensuing series, forcing a Jaguars punt. Perhaps the direction of the field is going to make a major difference in this game, as the Jaguars‚Äô field goal was a 52-yarder in the left-to-right direction.So far, Rodgers is 7-for-9 passing for 112 yards, with most of that damage coming on the score. He should have a better opportunity to open up the offense in the remainder of the second quarter with more friendly wind conditions."

Wide receiver Allen Lazard is back, as the team announced he has been reactivated from injured reserve on Tuesday.Lazard was placed on the injured reserve list following the Packers‚Äô week three game against the New Orleans Saints, a 37-30 victory for Green Bay. Lazard was one of the stars of that contest, catching six of eight targets for 146 yards and a touchdown with Davante Adams inactive. However, a core injury landed Lazard on the shelf days later, and he has missed each of the Packers next six games.The third-year receiver was designated for return on October 28th, allowing him to start practicing in time for the Packers‚Äô week eight contest against the Minnesota Vikings. With that clock beginning, the team had until Wednesday to activate him back to the active roster or else he would have by rule been shut down for the remainder of the season.In the Packers‚Äô first three games, Lazard was on the field for 88 percent of the team‚Äôs offensive snaps, many of them coming with him aligned in the slot. He totaled 13 receptions on 17 targets for 254 yards and a pair of scores over that period. With 11 of those catches going for first downs, he still holds the best receiving DVOA value (which measures per-target efficiency) of any wideout in the NFL with at least seven targets.The Packers did not have to make a move to make room for Lazard, as the team still had a pair of open spots on the active roster. Running back AJ Dillon and linebacker Krys Barnes remain on the reserve/COVID-19 list, and the team will need to open a spot if and when the two of them are ready to return."

It‚Äôs still too early to project Rashan Gary to follow in Jaire Alexander‚Äôs footsteps, but he has at least taken some big steps forward.Hopefully when the Green Bay Packers head to the practice field this afternoon, cornerback Jaire Alexander will be able to participate. The third-year cornerback missed the last six quarters of football after suffering a concussion against the 49ers, and although the defense did not seem to dip in effectiveness much, that surely would not be the case if he were to continue to miss time moving forward.Indeed, Alexander is the top-rated cornerback in the NFL by at least one set of analysts, and he has been a true lock-down player in every sense of the word this season. Sure, he has just one interception and three pass breakups. But he‚Äôs getting the Darrelle Revis or Richard Sherman treatment from opposing quarterbacks ‚Äî they simply are not throwing at him.While Alexander‚Äôs star turn has already taken place, the Packers are getting a growing feeling that they are seeing something similar from second-year edge rusher Rashan Gary. Perhaps Gary‚Äôs finest game as a pro came last Sunday against the Jaguars, when he sacked quarterback Jake Luton once and was responsible for several more pressures, many coming in the final few minutes.If Gary continues his ascent this season and looks like the consistent force on the edge that the Packers hoped he could become, that will portend good things for the defense moving forward. Matching up a young, elite corner with a talented young pass rusher and a veteran (but still only 25) at the top of his game in Kenny Clark should make for a tremendous core on that side of the football.What You Might‚Äôve Missed: Closing the door | Packers.com

We mentioned Gary a bit in this week's snap counts, but he seems to be healthy and turning on a switch.

On Friday, Paul Hornung passed away at the age of 84.The Louisville Sports Commission announced his passing around mid-day Friday. Hornung battled dementia over the past several years. He is now the fourth Pro Football Hall of Famer and member of the Green Bay Packers‚Äô 1960 championship teams to pass away in 2020, following Willie Wood, Willie Davis, and Herb Adderley.Nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Golden Boy,‚Äù Hornung won the Heisman Trophy in 1956, a few months before the Packers drafted him first overall in 1957. A versatile player in college at Notre Dame, Hornung primarily played halfback for the Packers and was a critical player on offense during Vince Lombardi‚Äôs tenure coaching the team. Though he accrued over 5,000 yards and scored 62 touchdowns in his career, he also served as the team‚Äôs primary place-kicker for several seasons, converting 66 of 140 field goal attempts and 190 of 194 extra points.Hornung played in four of the Packers‚Äô five championship teams in the 1960s before retiring following the 1966 season. He also famously sat out the 1963 season while on a suspension from the NFL for betting on games, but admitted his mistake and served his suspension without incident. Hornung was enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1986, ten years after the induction of Jim Taylor, his partner in the Packers‚Äô backfield.A native of Louisville, Kentucky, Hornung‚Äôs name adorns an award given out each year by the Louisville Sports Commission to the most versatile player in college football.

There will be cap casualties galore, and even if the Green Bay Packers get David Bakhtiari‚Äôs cap hit down to its lowest possible number ‚Äî around $11.2 million ‚Äî the team will still be around $10 million over the cap based on the players who are already under contract for next season.So while the Packers will have to trim some dead weight off the roster to get under the cap, they also see a pathway to being players in a strange free agency period, one where there will be less money to go around (at least for the first year of any multi-year contracts). That could lead to quality players hanging around in the free agent pool for longer than usual, and it could also result in some players taking one-year deals with the intent of cashing in bigger in 2022 when things are hopefully more back to normal.Whatever the offseason looks like, though, Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst is committed to making sure his team will be a player in that process. Today‚Äôs curds break look closely at his comments and how Bakhtiari‚Äôs deal could affect the Packers‚Äô other impending free agents, plus some comments from head coach Matt LaFleur about the performance of his team‚Äôs defense on Sunday.Packers‚Äô secondary gets mixed results without top two corners | Packers.com
Matt LaFleur was happy with his young cornerbacks in how they held up in coverage, but said that they need to get better in run support.Maligned defense delivers with game on the line | Packersnews.com
What LaFleur was particularly pleased about is how the defense stepped up on the Jaguars' final drive. The pass rush got home to sack Jake Luton twice and almost had another sack on the failed fourth down attempt, finally coming up with big plays to bail out the offense instead of relying on Aaron Rodgers and company to score 30.GM Brian Gutekunst: Packers want cap flexibility come March | Packers Wire
David Bakhtiari's contract structure certainly seems to count on a big salary cap bump in 2022, as it allows the Packers to keep his cost relatively under control next season. That will be critical as the Packers hope to be a player in what should be a bizarre free agent market in 2021.Next or never? What David Bakhtiari's deal with Packers means for Aaron Jones - Green Bay Packers Blog- ESPN
With Bakhtiari and Clark signed, however, and Gutey wanting to stay flexible in the spring, that will mean tough decisions on players like Jones, Kevin King, and Corey Linsley. But with only a few million dollars left in cap space for 2020, it seems unlikely that any of those players would get a new contract before the end of this season.Ponzi scheme suspect used underwater ‚Äòsea scooter‚Äô in Lake Shasta to evade FBI | KTLA

Out. Kevin King? Inactive. With the Green Bay Packers‚Äô two starting boundary cornerbacks unavailable against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, the team turned to a trio of young players ‚Äî a second-year pro and two third-year men ‚Äî to man the outside in week 10.All in all, the pass defense held up well, though they were defending against a Jaguars team that had a rookie sixth-round draft pick under center. But Ka‚ÄôDar Hollman, Josh Jackson, and Chandon Sullivan were largely up to the task, helping to hold Jake Luton to just 169 passing yards and allowing just over 50 percent of his pass attempts to be completed.The wind certainly played a factor as well, but the bigger struggles for the Packers came in the run game, where they allowed James Robinson to total over 100 yards and average better than 4.5 yards per carry. Christian Kirksey returned from injured reserve for this game and suited up on every defensive snap in the game, leading the team in tackles once again.Here‚Äôs a look at the playing time numbers from Sunday‚Äôs game, and we‚Äôll take a closer look at Marquez Valdes-Scantling‚Äôs great performance as we break things down by position.Aaron Rodgers 65Although Rodgers had a largely successful day ‚Äî his final line went 24-for-34 for 325 yards, two scores, and a pick ‚Äî it was a choppy day, particularly in the first quarter. Rodgers missed Robert Tonyan on a third down deep pass on the opening drive, a pass that he said was affected by the wind. But once the team switched directions to start the second quarter, he started opening up with deeper and intermediate throws, led off by the strike to Marquez Valdes-Scantling to start that quarter.Rodgers was sacked just once in the game, a ten-yard loss late in the second quarter that contributed to the Packers kicking a field goal instead of finding the end zone to end the half. He also added a five-yard rushing touchdown in the second quarter, but threw a bizarre and uncharacteristic interception late in the third that led to the Jaguars taking a 20-17 lead with a field goal.Aaron Jones 41, Jamaal Williams 31, Tyler Ervin 8The Packers‚Äô running backs had a very difficult time on the ground, as the Packers averaged just 3.2 yards per carry in the game. Jones led the way with 46 yards on 13 carries, but 20 of those yards came on one carry. He added 49 receiving yards on five catches, however, crossing 90 yards from scrimmage for just the third time this season.Williams picked up 55 total yards on the day, going 8-for-30 on the ground while catching three passes for 25. Ervin left the game just before halftime with an injury that the team announced was to his ribs; on special teams, the Packers replaced him with Josh Jackson on punt returns and Malik Taylor on kickoffs.Marquez Valdes-Scantling 60, Davante Adams 53, Equanimeous St. Brown 31, Malik Taylor 8, Juwann Winfree 7The Packers had just five explosive plays on Sunday, but three of them came courtesy of MVS. His 78-yard touchdown woke up the Packers a bit, but he also had two other gains of 20 yards or more ‚Äî a 31-yard gain in the third quarter and a 22-yarder over the middle to convert a third and six. All told, this was almost certainly his best game as a pro, as he caught four passes for a career-high 149 yards and did so without a drop.Adams had a rougher go throughout this contest. For a player who said just last week that it‚Äôs ‚Äúfair‚Äù to call him the best receiver in the NFL, he dropped two passes that hit him in the hands and lost a fumble on a long catch-and-run down the field. Both drops were contested plays ‚Äî he had his arms hit by the corner in coverage on the first and was hit from behind on the second ‚Äî but both are plays that a receiver of his caliber should make.Still, Adams bounced back. He would have had a ridiculous touchdown late in the first half if not for a holding penalty and he did find the end zone for the game-winning score in the fourth quarter on a tremendous leaping grab. That touchdown even came after he had to sit out for a time dealing with an ankle issue, which will require monitoring moving forward.Robert Tonyan 40, Marcedes Lewis 26, Jace Sternberger 20The only tight end targets in the game went to Tonyan, who caught three of four passes thrown his way for 33 yards. Lewis appeared to be a potential target on Rodgers‚Äô running score, as the QB sprinted to the right off a play-fake with Lewis and St. Brown releasing into the right side of the end zone. Lewis got clogged up with a defender, however, but it would stand to reason that the Packers wanted to get him a score against his old team.David Bakhtiari 65, Elgton Jenkins 65, Corey Linsley 65, Lucas Patrick 65, Billy Turner 65The Packers‚Äô line held up entirely throughout the game, with Bakhtiari returning from broken ribs. He and the rest of the line played every snap and largely kept Rodgers upright, though they got little push in the run game. The biggest issues in pass protection were a pair of penalties by Turner, one hold that wiped away a touchdown and a chop-block flag that resulted him from him being thrown aside by the rusher opposite him, causing him to fall uncontrolled into the legs of another defender who was already engaged.Kenny Clark 57, Dean Lowry 39, Tyler Lancaster 22, Kingsley Keke 14, Montravius Adams 14James Robinson gained 109 yards on 23 carries as the only player to carry the football for Jacksonville, and the Packers‚Äô line was often on skates at the snap. Clark is clearly fully healthy, as he played nearly every snap in this game against the Jaguars, and he made five total tackles, a few of them down the field. Lowry‚Äôs only entry on the stat sheet was a pass breakup at the line, while Lancaster had a pair of assisted tackles and Adams had one solo stop.Za‚ÄôDarius Smith 53, Preston Smith 52, Rashan Gary 31The Packers got one sack each from their three edge rushers in this game, and all came at critical times. Z‚Äôs sack came on a third down to force a punt early on in the third quarter, while Gary and Preston came up with their sacks on the final series of the game to force a long 4th down attempt that eventually failed.Gary had one of his better games of the year as a pass-rusher, as he had that sack on second down of the last series and provided the initial pressure on the third-down sack by Preston Smith. He appears to be understanding his own skill set better on the rush, using more speed-to-power rushes than trying to bend around the edge.Christian Kirksey 64, Kamal Martin 13, Oren Burks 5The Packers got Kirksey back for this game, and he returned to his every-down position in the middle of the defense. He had seven total tackles to lead the team. With Krys Barnes still on the reserve/COVID-19 list, Martin got the snaps as the weak-side inside linebacker when the team stuck to a two-linebacker alignment, though he did not appear on the stat sheet.Adrian Amos 64, Darnell Savage 61, Raven Greene 39, Vernon Scott 1The Packers went with Greene as the dime linebacker in most cases, and he totaled three solo tackles and a big pass breakup. Amos had the Packers‚Äô only turnover in the game, an interception on a nice break on Tyler Eifert, who slipped and fell just before the football arrived; that play turned into three points for the Packers near the end of the first half. Savage had a few nice moments as well, with two pass breakups and five total tackles.Chandon Sullivan 64, Josh Jackson 60, Ka‚ÄôDar Hollman 51With Jaire Alexander and Kevin King out, the Packers used the trio of Sullivan, Jackson, and Hollman at corner. When all three were on the field, it was Jackson and Hollman on the boundary with Sullivan in his traditional alignment in the slot, and he bounced back outside when the team went to a base defense with just two corners.Sullivan did allow a touchdown pass to Keelan Cole and he got flagged for a pass interference penalty on a play when his receiver was not targeted and he actually knocked down the pass. He also recorded six total tackles. Hollman had four solo stops and a pass breakup, while Jackson had three total tackles.Burks 25, Randy Ramsey 25, Ty Summers 25, M.

Here‚Äôs your schedule and open thread for Sunday.A bizarre quirk of scheduling is taking place today across the NFL. Because the Masters golf tournament is taking place this weekend and concludes with the final round this afternoon, CBS ‚Äî which airs that tournament ‚Äî is not showing a single football game in the early afternoon time slot today.Instead, that network has just three games today, all of which will kick off at 3:05 PM Central. Of those games, the most widely-distributed contest pits the 7-2 Buffalo Bills against the 5-3 Arizona Cardinals in what should be an exciting inter-conference matchup.FOX, therefore, gets to air early games against the end of the Masters, showing five games that kick off at 12 noon Central time. The Green Bay Packers‚Äô matchup with the Jacksonville Jaguars is one of the early games, but with four other contests taking place, it will not be on local television in large swaths of the country.RELATEDThe late games on FOX should be intriguing, however, with the Seahawks‚Äô visit to play the Rams being arguably the best matchup.

Lazard signed with Jacksonville as an free agent after he was not selected in the 2018 NFL Draft, and he stuck around on their practice squad until the Packers signed him away late that season. Since then, he has become an important contributor to the Green Bay offense but he will not start in the two teams‚Äô week 10 meeting. Lazard must come off injured reserve next week or else the team will forfeit their ability to bring him back this season.Instead, the Packers brought just one player back to the active roster from injured reserve: linebacker Christian Kirksey, whose last game action also came against New Orleans. Kirksey signed with the Packers this offseason to be the team‚Äôs starting middle linebacker, and he had played every defensive snap prior to his injury. In his absence, the Packers have turned to first- and second-year players like Krys Barnes, Ty Summers, and Kamal Martin at that position.On Friday, head coach Matt LaFleur indicated that both Lazard and Kirksey would be game-time decisions, but he sounded more optimistic about Kirksey‚Äôs availability. This move all but assures that Kirksey will be active and in the starting lineup on Sunday.Due to two players currently residing on the reserve/COVID-19 list, the Packers had two roster spots open for these two players, so no matching roster transactions are needed. However, the team did open up a roster spot for Kirksey, moving tight end/fullback John Lovett to injured reserve. Lovett reportedly suffered a torn ACL in practice this week and will be out for the remainder of the season.As a result, the Packers were able to elevate four players from the practice squad for gameday ‚Äî two as emergency COVID replacements and two as standard elevations. Safety Henry Black should make his fourth appearance as a Packer, as he and wide receiver Juwann Winfree were designated as the COVID-19 replacement players. Meanwhile, the Packers used their standard elevation designations on a pair of cornerbacks, Stanford Samuels and KeiVarae Russell. Samuels was active last week as well, while Russell is a fairly recent addition to the organization.Based on the positions of these players, it appears likely that the Packers will not have the services of one or both of their starting cornerbacks on Sunday. Jaire Alexander was listed as doubtful with a concussion on Friday‚Äôs injury report, while Kevin King is questionable with a quad injury that has cost him the last four games. Look for at least one of Samuels and Russell ‚Äî likely both ‚Äî to suit up, even if King is able to play."

A possible mauling could ensue.The return of David Bakhtiari carries effects that will reverberate through the Green Bay Packers offense and make them a prime source of fantasy output this coming week. Adding the best left tackle back to an offensive line that has been elite all season is obviously a good thing, but the matchup on the week is even more juicy as the Packers take on the Jacksonville Jaguars.The Jaguars have had a rough go of it this season and their efficiency numbers really reflect that through 10 weeks. They rank last in overall team defense DVOA, last in Pass Defense DVOA, and 21st in Run Defense DVOA. Overall, the Jags are allowing the second most yards per game in the league, fifth most passing yards, and sixth most rushing yards.If you think the Packers have been hit with the injury bug, the Jaguars haven‚Äôt been skating by easy in that department either. They‚Äôll be out a starting defensive tackle, Doug Costin, on Sunday, while their depth is really hurting. They have six defensive backups on IR and another four listed as Out for this week. If the Packers decide to grind the Jaguars into the turf on Sunday, they can easily wear this team out as Jacksonville rotates career backups onto the field.As stated before, the Packers have already had stellar line play this season, but Bakhtiari puts it back at a peak form. Aaron Jones just came back from injury last week after missing a couple games himself. He saw 20 total touches during that game, but a healthy Jones could see more like 22-24 touches as he did earlier in the season. Currently, Jacksonville is allowing the sixth most fantasy points to opposing running backs.The Packers should add a good amount of passing to stay balanced and, to be fair, on any given Sunday any team can win. The Packers have kept Aaron Rodgers clean all season. They have an NFL best 76 percent Pass Block Win Rate (and NFL best 74 percent Run Block Win Rate, by the way), per ESPN. Further, the Packers have elite players winning their matchups all over the line. Per ESPN, Billy Turner and Bakhtiari are in the top five in OT Pass Block Win Rate (second and fifth, respectively). Lucas Patrick and Elgton Jenkins are eighth and ninth in OG Pass Block Win Rate, respectively. And Corey Linsley is ranked third for centers in Pass Block Win Rate.If you‚Äôre of the mindset that winning starts in the trenches, fire up all your Packers players for fantasy this week.

On Monday afternoon, the Packers announced that they have activated running back Jamaal Williams and linebacker Kamal Martin from the reserve/COVID-19 list, placing them back on the active roster.Williams and Martin went on the COVID list last week after contact tracing deemed them to be high-risk close contacts with running back AJ Dillon. Dillon reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 last week and remains on the reserve list.All three of these players were inactive when the Packers defeated the San Francisco 49ers 34-17 on Thursday night. With a long week to prepare for the Jaguars, the Packers returned to the practice field on Monday, and Williams and Martin participated normally in that practice session. They should be ready to play on Sunday barring any further positive tests on the team.Williams played in each of the Packers‚Äô first seven games in 2020, starting three of them. He has carried the football 68 times for 294 yards and one touchdown and has added 23 receptions for 183 yards. That puts him on pace for career highs in receiving production this season. Martin made his NFL debut in the Packers‚Äô week 7 victory over the Houston Texans. In two games (both starts), he has accrued nine total tackles (seven solo) in 71 snaps on defense.The Packers are now down to three players on reserve/COVID: Dillon; linebacker Krys Barnes, who tested positive late last week; and quarterback Jordan Love, who is a close contact of Barnes due to the two players living together."

Who needs ‚Äòem anyway?If you buy something from an SB Nation link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.This year, we thought it all would change. Green Bay Packers fans thought that this would finally be the year that the team would draft a receiver for Aaron Rodgers in the first round of the NFL Draft to help push the team over the hump and back into the Super Bowl.Of course, that didn‚Äôt happen. But something even more shocking did: the Packers became the best offense in the NFL without any significant additions to the receiving corps.Through four games in 2020, the team is leading the NFL in offense by DVOA (more on that here). But although Aaron Rodgers has doubled his total career passing touchdowns thrown to former first-round draft picks, he has taken that number from one to two with his second career scoring toss to former Jaguars first-round tight end Marcedes Lewis.Instead, it has been a second-round pick (Davante Adams), a pair of fifth-rounders (Marquez Valdes-Scantling and running back Aaron Jones), and some undrafted players (Allen Lazard and Robert Tonyan) who have been the biggest playmakers for this offense. So when you think about it, who really needs first-rounders anyway?With that question in mind, our partners at BreakingT have come up with a great new t-shirt design to poke some fun at the team‚Äôs consistent insistence on drafting other positions in round one:As with all t-shirts sold during the 2020 season, APC will donate 100% of our portion of the proceeds to charity, with our current choice being the National Math and Science Initiative."

On Wednesday afternoon, the team announced that there will be no fans in Lambeau Field for the next home game, scheduled for a week from Sunday.That contest is scheduled for November 15th, with the Jacksonville Jaguars as the visiting opponent. An excerpt from the Packers‚Äô statement below notes that the rate of community transmission in Wisconsin and the Green Bay area is a primary reason for the decisionIn order to host fans, the area will need to see a significant improvement in the rate of hospitalizations, as well as in the community infection and positivity rates. This is based on recommendations from community healthcare and public health officials.The Packers themselves experienced their first positive COVID-19 tests of the regular season this week, when A.J. Dillon landed on the reserve/COVID-19 list after reportedly testing positive. Fellow running back Jamaal Williams was placed on the list as well on Tuesday after being designated as a high-risk close contact with Dillon, and both players will miss Thursday‚Äôs game against the San Francisco 49ers. That game will also be played in front of an empty stadium due to orders from Santa Clara County.After the home game against Jacksonville, the Packers will play the Indianapolis Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium before returning to Lambeau Field for a date with the Chicago Bears on the Sunday following Thanksgiving.

David Bakhtiari signed his first contract extension that week, and the Packers went on to win a tight, four-point game against a Jaguars team that proved to be spunkier than expected (and one that would finish 3-13 on the season).There is a vast number of parallels between that week and the last few days. Over the last week, the Packers again played the Jaguars. They again squeaked out a four-point victory over a bad Jacksonville team, one that looks headed for a similar final record. And once again, David Bakhtiari signed a big new contract extension, this one coming just hours before kickoff.So while the Packers‚Äô ugly victory is among the headlines from Sunday, Bakhtiari‚Äôs new contract ‚Äî which makes him the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history ‚Äî is the bigger deal, figuratively speaking.

You can CLICK HERE for straight up NFL picks without regard to the spread. You can find all of the NFL betting lines via DraftKings.My overall record so far is 66-65-2 after going 5-9 last week. The BGN community is two games behind at 64-67-2.Here are suggestions when trying to beat the odds.JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS at GREEN BAY PACKERS (-14): Jake Luton showed some promise last week and James Robinson could prove to be a problem for the Packers‚Äô run defense. Aaron Rodgers does enough to help the Packers win the game but the Jags find a way to cover. PICK: Jaguars +14TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS (-6) at CAROLINA PANTHERS: Easy to be concerned about the Bucs after their last two games. They trailed for most of their game against NYG and then they got blown out by New Orleans. But Tom Brady has a history of bouncing back and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôll do here against the Bucs. The Panthers fight hard and they‚Äôre coming off a good game but Teddy Bridgewater will cost them here. PICK: Buccaneers -6PHILADELPHIA EAGLES (-4) at NEW YORK GIANTS: The Eagles are much healthier than they were the last time they faced the Giants and almost lost. But improved health doesn‚Äôt necessarily guarantee better performance. The Birds started out 0-2-1 when they were healthier earlier in the season. Philly ranks worse than New York in DVOA and it feels like the G-Men are due for a win. At the very least, this game should be close. Take the points. PICK: Giants +4HOUSTON TEXANS at CLEVELAND BROWNS (-4): The Browns are getting Nick Chubb back coming off their bye week. Running the ball is crucial to Cleveland‚Äôs success and they should be able to take advantage of an entirely gettable Houston defense. The Browns really need this game to stay well-positioned in the AFC playoff picture. PICK: Browns -4WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM at DETROIT LIONS (-3.5): Alex Smith probably just isn‚Äôt the same player he used to be but I do think he can find a way to limit the turnovers that plagued him last week. Washington‚Äôs No. 1 overall ranked DVOA pass defense (!) will shut down Matt Stanford while their offense does just enough to get the win. Matt Patricia might finally be fired after this loss. PICK: Football Team +3.5BUFFALO BILLS at ARIZONA CARDINALS (-2.5): This should be a fun one. Josh Allen is coming off a bounce-back performance and Kyler Murray is playing his best ball recently. These teams are fairly even matched but I trust Murray a little more so that‚Äôs the direction I‚Äôll go. Then again, I do worry about Kliff Kingsbury continuing to be a coward. PICK: Cardinals -2.5LOS ANGELES CHARGERS at MIAMI DOLPHINS (-1.5): I really like Justin Herbert. More so than Tua Tagovailoa. But it‚Äôs so hard to trust the Bolts to finish and the Dolphins are looking like a legitimately good team. I want to take the Chargers but I have to take Miami in what‚Äôs essentially a pick ‚Äòem. PICK: Dolphins -1.5DENVER BRONCOS at LAS VEGAS RAIDERS (-3.5): Drew Lock hasn‚Äôt been looking as bad as he was earlier in the season. But I don‚Äôt really trust him still. There‚Äôs a case to be made both of these teams aren‚Äôt as good as their records indicate. Denver is 29th in DVOA and Las Vegas is only 22nd. Hm ... maybe the points are the play here even though I think the Raiders will win. PICK: Broncos +3.5CINCINNATI BENGALS at PITTSBURGH STEELERS (-7): The Steelers are going to lose eventually, right? They‚Äôve come close the past couple weeks. The Bengals are coming off their bye and Joe Burrow is looking to score a signature win in this spot. Cincy should at least find a way to cover. PICK: Bengals +7SEATTLE SEAHAWKS at LOS ANGELES RAMS (-2.5): The Rams‚Äô defense is a lot better than the Seahawks‚Äô defense. But I can‚Äôt possibly take Jared Goff over Russell Wilson, especially when the latter is getting points. PICK: Seahawks +2.5SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS at NEW ORLEANS SAINTS (-9.5): The 49ers are just too depleted and the Saints are hitting their stride with Michael Thomas back. PICK: Saints -9.5BALTIMORE RAVENS (-7) at NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS: It wouldn‚Äôt really make sense for the Pats to almost lose to the Jets and then cover against the Pats. So it‚Äôll happen. Especially with Baltimore‚Äôs offense still not looking right. PICK: Patriots +7MINNESOTA VIKINGS (-3) at CHICAGO BEARS: Dalvin Cook is a monster. He‚Äôs able to mask Kirk Cousins‚Äô deficiencies. Nick Foles is really struggling. So naturally he‚Äôll make me regret picking against him. PICK: Vikings -3"

He ranks first overall in Football Outsiders‚Äô DVOA and DYAR metrics. He ranks second overall in Pro Football Focus grading.Jefferson‚Äôs 54 targets have resulted in:Jefferson has clearly debunked the myth that he‚Äôs merely a slot receiver (43rd in slot percentage) or simply just a product of getting to play with Joe Burrow in LSU‚Äôs high-powered offense.Reagor‚Äôs numbers obviously don‚Äôt compare, in part because he missed five games due to injury. But availability is part of the equation.Reagor‚Äôs 21 targets have resulted in:Reagor also ranks 100th out of 112 receivers graded by PFF this season. Some of his struggles were recently on display in the Eagles‚Äô loss to the New York Giants.Don't wanna be that guy who criticizes a 1st round rookie too much when the whole offense sucks - but Reagor had some bad reps on tape this week. Thought this summed up his day. Body language isn't great either in all honesty. pic.twitter.com/tHnJranKu7The Eagles' last significant snap against the Giants: 4th and 10, down by 7, 5 minutes left.

A great microcosm for their game because the entire thing sucked.

Tough read, tough throw from Wentz
Bad route from Reagor (+ others!)
Poor play-call/decision from Doug

Go Birds! pic.twitter.com/ayfeELz9xOWelp pic.twitter.com/iuPQuN2YunIt‚Äôs important to note that the criticism of taking Reagor over Jefferson isn‚Äôt limited to hindsight. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in results-oriented thinking when there should instead be more focus on the process (shoutout to Sam Hinkie). There was plenty of reason to think the Eagles shouldn‚Äôt have passed on Jefferson to take Reagor at the time.Bleeding Green Nation made the case for Jefferson on multiple occasions before the draft.From April 16th:The Eagles did ‚Ä¶ literally nothing ‚Ä¶ to address their dire wide receiver situation through free agency, so the team MUST address the position early in the draft.Justin Jefferson isn‚Äôt the most ideal fit in that he isn‚Äôt the explosive burner that Philly could really afford to add. But the Eagles don‚Äôt *just* need to add speed; they need good receivers, period, and there‚Äôs a lot to like about Jefferson‚Äôs profile.He only turned 21 in January, he boasts an elite relative athletic score, he produced at a high level for a national champion in 2019, he has experience playing both the slot and outside, and he has a revered work ethic. Jefferson checks a lot of boxes and that‚Äôs important for an Eagles team that‚Äôs regularly failed to draft and develop receiver talent since Howie Roseman first came to power in 2010.There are rarely sure things in the draft, but Jefferson feels like an especially reasonable bet. He could be a reliable weapon for Wentz for years to come.From April 22nd:Is [Jefferson] the most ideal fit in a perfect world? No, he‚Äôs not the burner the Eagles could really afford to add. But the Eagles don‚Äôt just need pure speed. They also need some receivers who are just legitimately good players and everything about Jefferson‚Äôs profile suggests he‚Äôll be able to make a successful transition to the NFL. His projection should be valued by an Eagles team that‚Äôs regularly failed to draft and develop receiver talent under Howie Roseman. Given the barren state of the receiving corps, Philly can‚Äôt afford another flat out bust. Jefferson is a high floor, high ceiling prospect. Adding him to the roster would give Carson Wentz a receiver who‚Äôs actually reliable ... unlike Agholor.Unfortunately, Roseman ignored our sage advice. He seemingly got too obsessed with ‚Äúfit‚Äù and speed instead of focusing on just drafting a really good talent. Concerning to see so much focus on ‚Äúneed.‚ÄùHowie Roseman cited ""fit"" when specifically asked about taking Jalen Reagor over Justin Jefferson. #Eagles pic.twitter.com/ASe8iZEyOFFormer Eagles scout Daniel Jeremiah, who has a good relationship with Roseman, even had the following to say after the Reagor pick:The Eagles really wanted speed. Reagor provides that. I just couldn't pass up my 14th rated player (Justin Jefferson) for my 56th player (Reagor). It'll be fascinating to follow both of their careers.The Vikings were also pretty stoked when the Eagles passed on Jefferson. Watch the disbelief from Mike Zimmer and Rick Spielman here:WOW #Vikings GM Rick & HC Zimmer faces when #Eagles picked J. Reagor pic.twitter.com/xaVXyIUSTBOuch.Let‚Äôs make this clear: this post isn‚Äôt suggesting Reagor is a total bust and there‚Äôs no hope for him. Reagor did some nice things in training camp and he‚Äôs flashed some big play ability. He‚Äôs only 21 years old and he seems like a hard-working kid who genuinely wants to improve. Perhaps Reagor would even be posting bigger numbers than he is right now if he wasn‚Äôt saddled with (yet another) struggling quarterback.But it‚Äôs also not a foregone conclusion that Reagor will actually be good. I mean, are we really just going to assume the GM who drafted J.J. Arcega-Whiteside over D.K. Metcalf definitely got this pick right? It‚Äôs possible Reagor could be the latest example of Roseman‚Äôs poor track record when it comes to drafting receivers.Even if Reagor does turn out to be good, it‚Äôs not like the Eagles‚Äô selection was made in a vacuum. There‚Äôs absolutely opportunity cost to consider. If Jefferson turns out to be a bonafide star while Reagor is merely a nice player, that‚Äôs still a bad look for a front office that has a reputation of not drafting well enough. Even more so when the Eagles‚Äô offseason plan at receiver involved eschewing veteran options like DeAndre Hopkins to only rely on getting a total stud at No. 21.Which, so far, the Eagles have not gotten. And the Vikings have."

Even worse, apparently.The New York GiantsDo you know how bad you have to be to lose the Giants under Daniel Jones? You have to be the Washington Football Team level of bad ‚Äî wait, I‚Äôm getting word that the Eagles have also lost to the Washington Football Team.Well, there you go.Nate GerryTurns out Nate Gerry is still the best linebacker the Eagles have on their roster? Probably not, but while he doesn‚Äôt make many impact plays, the Eagles don‚Äôt have any more impressive alternatives.Jeffrey LurieThis is our first time dropping the owner‚Äôs name anywhere in this column, but it feels appropriate. The Eagles are 2-2 against the worst division in the last forever and just lost a critical game out of a bye week against a measurably inferior opponent. They continue to be weak in the same areas in which they‚Äôve been weak for multiple years, and the glue that held things together in seasons past is finally giving.As such, the Eagles‚Äô latest implosion is an exercise in tracking the buck and asking where it stops. Why was Jason Peters playing left tackle when he was signed to play guard, a position at which the Eagles desperately needed better play? Why has whatever inexplicable dichotomy between Howie Roseman and Jim Schwartz led to the steady bleeding of defensive talent over the last four seasons? Why was Alshon Jeffery activated?You can point to Doug and Howie and Schwartz for all of these issues, and rightfully so ‚Äî but that buck stops with Lurie, who fired the Eagles‚Äô lame-duck offensive coordinator last year to no avail, and now must make a more substantive move between those three spearheads. You cannot continue to entertain this balance of units between Pederson and Schwartz, as the Eagles simply do not have their offense and defense play well at the same time. You cannot continue to give Roseman the freedom to aggressively extend veteran deals for an offense that is groaning for young talent. The buck stops with Lurie, and it‚Äôs time for him to make a change.Doug PedersonWorst Pederson game I can remember. Didn‚Äôt take some fourth downs he should have, didn‚Äôt call plays on third down to set up fourth down, made a wanton decision to go for a 2-point conversion down 4, and most importantly, brought a flat, unchanged, uninspired, rusty team out of the bye week for the fourth time in his career.Isn‚Äôt he pissed? Isn‚Äôt he tired of this? Doesn‚Äôt he want his job to be easier? The offense is panicky, afraid of its own quarterback, dedicated to Richard Rodgers and Greg Ward while Travis Fulgham and Dallas Goedert fall useless to the wayside. Pederson has failed to integrate any new ideas into the offense and regularly limits the existing offense with a the caricuture of freshness and ingenuity that is a Jalen Hurts power read. This is an aimless coaching staff.Sua Opeta/Matt PryorNeither are rosterableJason KelceI could have picked better weeks for Jason Kelce to forget how to snap. While no missed shotgun snap ended in a turnover, they killed multiple drives, forcing sacks and fruitless runs. Kelce is the leader of the team and failed them in the basic, critical sense repeatedly in a must-win game for their fading playoff hopes.Fletcher Cox/Malik Jackson/Javon HargraveSpeaking of leaders and their failures, BLG loves to remind us how much money the Eagles have poured into their defensive front, and appropriately so. The Birds are paying more to defensive tackles than anyone else in the league, and for it, they‚Äôre getting poor play. The Eagles got smashed in the mouth repeated by an offensive line largely starting backups and two depth chart running backs, as their defensive line simply could not win the battle in the trenches. But congrats to Fletch on his Hail Mary sack to end the first half.Jalen HurtsSorry Jalen. Love you, but I hope I never see you again unless it‚Äôs as the actual quarterback of this team.Alshon JefferyOn the roster for 10 weeks, finally active, and his impact on the passing game was exactly that if he had been IR‚Äôed for the season ‚Äî or better yet, traded away for literally anything. It is a joke that he remains a piece of weekly news.Avonte MaddoxMore mercy for Maddox than for others in our loser column, as he‚Äôs being asked to do something no cogent coaching staff would ask of him: play outside corner at one of the most significant height/length disadvantages of any defensive back in the league. Maddox is a slot corner playing outside with no safety help ‚Äî not because of injury, but because that‚Äôs exactly what the defensive coordinator wanted from him coming into the season.With that said, Maddox has gotta just start committing DPI at the catch point and hoping it doesn‚Äôt get called. Praying for an inaccurate pass from an ineffectual trail technique is just laughable at this point.Davion TaylorHe took some snaps this week on defense! Can‚Äôt remember a good one, but he did.Dave FippThe Eagles‚Äô special teams has been reprehensible all year. Both Greg Ward and Jalen Reagor allowed punts that should have been fielded to bounce inside of the 10, while a big Giants punt return allowed for a potential field goal attempt to end the first half. The Eagles weren‚Äôt playing well on both sides of the football anyway, but they could have used some more help from the third, hidden phase.Jim SchwartzI dunno why you‚Äôd let Jim Schwartz keep his job after this season. Name a defensive player who has developed under his tutelage; a free agent investment that has seen good return on the dollar. You can think of some late-round draft picks and some cheap free agents, but none of their big money acquisitions or moves have paid off. The only games in which the defense delivers are games in which their defensive line dominates, and they paid league-leading money to get that defense line. There is nothing on which Schwartz can hang his hat, and there probably hasn‚Äôt been for a while."

25Way to really help out a struggling offense.Howie Roseman built the NFL‚Äôs second most expensive team and that group has a 3-5-1 record to show for it.And so on.You‚Äôre well within your rights to get frustrated at the coaching staff. But you can‚Äôt forget about Roseman‚Äôs role in these struggles. He shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to pick a third head coach in eight years.This loss wasn‚Äôt on Wentz alone. The offensive line and coaching staff failed him too often. And he didn‚Äôt turn the ball over (gasp!), which was good to see.But inaccuracy was still an issue early as the Eagles fell into a hole. He sailed some throws, as he‚Äôs wont to do. Indecision also proved costly:.@eagles opening drive on 3-3. It‚Äôs a good play v the anticipate MAN2MAN coverage. But you can‚Äôt be late. You can‚Äôt hitch 2X; the ball has to be delivered on time otherwise you allow the defender time to recover. #BaldysBreakdowns pic.twitter.com/ydIOicCBHyWe can‚Äôt just always keep making excuses for Wentz. The bottom line is the Eagles need their $128 million quarterback to play much better than this.Most starts with QBR below 50 this season:

Carson Wentz (6)
Drew Lock (5)
Joe Burrow (4)
Baker Mayfield (4)
Philip Rivers (4)
Nick Foles (4)
Sam Darnold (4)
Gardner Minshew (4)
Dwayne Haskins (4)

Wentz has played more bad games than any QB in the NFL.Wentz shares ample responsibility for the offense only scoring 17 points and failing to convert a third down. Especially when you consider his influence on the offense. I‚Äôll have you recall my conversation with Joe Santoliquito from earlier this year:There‚Äôs also something else here. And we‚Äôll just say a little bird very recently whispered into my ear. Who has a lot of intimate knowledge on what goes on in that building and what goes on in that quarterbacks room. Doug Pederson took a lot of blame for that [Week 1] loss and play-calling on Sunday. And he has to accept a certain level, a certain percentage of that. But most of the percentage of that play-calling has to fall on 11. He‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs calling the plays at the line of scrimmage. He‚Äôs the one calling the offense. I don‚Äôt know exactly the percentage of what he‚Äôs calling, of what Doug‚Äôs calling, but [Wentz] is calling a lot of that offense. And Carson‚Äôs view of this offense ‚Äî remember, Doug started to mold the offense what towards Carson likes. And, again, we‚Äôre talking five years here. This pretty much Wentz‚Äôs offense. This is speculation but strong, strong, strong support that Wentz kind of wants to run this in the sense that, for example, when Peyton Manning was with the Colts and then was with the Broncos, that was Peyton Manning‚Äôs offense. And I strongly believe that this is ‚Äî it‚Äôs Doug Pederson‚Äôs play design, Doug Pederson is one of the best play designers in the NFL. And Doug, 4th-and-1, that‚Äôs Doug‚Äôs call. Doug Pederson makes those calls. But in terms of walking up at the line of scrimmage, calling the plays at the line of scrimmages, running some fake cadence ‚Ä¶ Again, I don‚Äôt know the exact percentage. But there‚Äôs a hell of a lot of plays being called by Carson Wentz. And that play selection‚Äôs being done ‚Äî well, for example, Doug may call a play. Carson doesn‚Äôt like it. And Carson will call his own play. Again, I don‚Äôt know the percentage of that, but if you watch that [Washington] game closely on TV, you‚Äôll notice 11 making a lot of calls at the line of scrimmage and they are his calls. So when you turn around and you want to point a finger at Pederson, and play-calling, and things like that, it might be a good idea to take that step back and take a broader look at who may actually be at fault here.With this in mind, I‚Äôm really curious to see how the offense might look with Jalen Hurts running the show. I‚Äôd also be curious to see how Wentz responds to an in-game benching. To be clear, though, I don‚Äôt expect that to happen. I mean, does Pederson even have the power to make that call?The Eagles‚Äô next five games:I think the Eagles might actually be able to steal one of those. Two at the very most. But there‚Äôs a very real chance they don‚Äôt win a single one as they‚Äôll be underdogs in every matchup. Five straight losses could be on the way.Sigh.The Eagles might be able to win this division with only two more wins. It‚Äôs possible that even one could do it. Imagine the Eagles being in the playoffs at 4-11-1 or 5-10-1. Just incredibly undeserved."

Schwartz talked about allowing back-to-back touchdowns, the lack of turnovers, and how they‚Äôre preparing for Cleveland‚Äôs run game.Here‚Äôs what the defensive coordinator had to say:Schwartz admitted the defense broke down on the run for a touchdown by Jones, but wouldn‚Äôt assign individual blame. The 80-yard run a few weeks ago was due to them running out of a formation they hadn‚Äôt seen before, but that‚Äôs what made the touchdown run even more embarrassing on Sunday.‚ÄúIt was embarrassing in this game because they ran out of the exact same formation, and we fit it wrong. And, the guy that‚Äôs supposed to be there for the quarterback wasn‚Äôt there, nobody else got off any blocks, and he made us pay with a touchdown.The other one that got called back with a penalty, the hold affected that play and then also caused us ‚Äî well, we had a chance to get him in the backfield, and it was more of a physical play on that one, that got called back.‚ÄùSchwartz noted that there were a lot of those plays that the guys executed very well, but particularly early in the game and on that first drive, they weren‚Äôt up to the challenge and it cost them. He said bluntly that the way they started the game had a lot to do with the end result.The DC talked about how particularly in the first series, they couldn‚Äôt get to third down. He explained that they got the sack on the first play, but then in a 2nd-and-long situation, the played cover 2 and let a ball get ripped right past them for a first down. Those little mistakes added up throughout the drive because they couldn‚Äôt get to 3rd-and-long situations.Schwartz did note that he understands why his guys jumped on 3rd down and 13, because the center moved the ball and went back on his heels ‚Äî the refs didn‚Äôt see it ‚Äî but that put the Giants‚Äô offense at 3rd-and-3 and in a much better situation for a quick shuttle pass for 4 yards and another first down. But, those are the type of little things that ended up making a big different.‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôd say this: almost no turnovers are scheme-related. It‚Äôs not like you do something scheme-wise that causes a forced fumble or things like that. It really just comes from continual pressure. There are some plays that are close. I think if you go back and look at some of this stuff, we had about ten plays that we were like on the ball in the pocket, like a defensive lineman was making contact with the ball. One of those, Brandon Graham made and the ball threw incomplete on the third down right at midfield near the end of the first half.Those are the plays that cause turnovers. You‚Äôre not going to make those all the time but the continual big hits on the running back, we didn‚Äôt have enough of those. We didn‚Äôt have second-level guys coming in and wiping out piles and causing those kind of things. The continual pressure on the quarterback, where he steps ‚Äî he has to step back and lets a ball like hang up a little bit. There were a lot of balls that we had ‚Äî we were close to getting a hand on or a tip. Close doesn‚Äôt count in this league. It‚Äôs a win or a loss and we lost the game. It‚Äôs that continual pressure.‚ÄùSchwartz was asked about the Giants‚Äô offensive drive following the Boston Scott touchdown, when Jones threw a 27-yard pass to Sterling Shephard followed by a 38-yard pass to Golden Tate. The DC agreed that it was a really important sequence, and noted that they had gone to more man-to-man because they were inches away from making plays on some of the throws into tight windows. When they went man-to-man, it left them vulnerable to some passes down the field.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our biggest challenge of the season in the run game. And how well we stop the run is going to go a long way to how well we play in this game. They are an outstanding run team. Probably the best two running backs we face this year. Not just the best two on the team, but the best two overall. Great balance. Great power. They know what they want to do in the run game. Nothing sort of takes them out of it. There‚Äôs not a whole lot you can do scheme-wise that forces them to do something else. They are going to run it. It doesn‚Äôt matter what your look is and they are going to take that attitude of if you have an unblocked guy, the running back is going to try to run over them.It‚Äôs going to take everybody, it‚Äôs not just the defensive linemen, it‚Äôs not just the linebackers; our corners are going to have to have an outstanding game defending the run. There‚Äôs some carryover to like San Francisco. There are some similarities in what the run game is. We have to do a good job on stopping that zone stretch and taking their power run games. They are a good contact-running team and like I said both of those guys, [Kareem] Hunt and [Nick] Chubb are both outstanding running backs and it‚Äôs going to be our biggest challenge of the year and we need to be up to that challenge.‚Äù"

Lol.The hunt for .500 starts today!The last time the Eagles lost to New York, it was Wentz and Pederson‚Äôs rookie seasons: a 28-23 contest in which Wentz completed just over 50% of his passes and threw two interceptions to zero touchdowns. Let‚Äôs hope we get a better effort than that this time around.What‚Äôs interesting about the Eagles‚Äô wining streak against the Giants isn‚Äôt the length, but rather the unlikely odds it has endured. In four of those eight wins, the Giants have held multiple score leads at some point in the game, including two in the second. The game from a few weeks ago was one such game, as the Giants were ahead 21-10 after scoring with 6:21 left in regulation.The Eagles have been playing with fire in all of these New York games going all the way back to 2017, when a Jake Elliott 61-yard field goal allowed the Eagles to escape overtime after surrendering a 14-point fourth-quarter lead in their own right. This is not the team to mess around with, either: Joe Judge‚Äôs Giants, 2-7 on the year, have only played in two games decided by more than one possession (0-2), so they‚Äôre due for some positive regression on their 2-5 record in close games.While the Giants have been prone to giving up big cushions so far this year, and historically against the Eagles, Philadelphia should try to do that which they haven‚Äôt all season: generate a commanding lead. Eventually, the Giants‚Äô luck on these deficits is going to break their way.503 - That‚Äôs how many receiving yards the Giants have allowed to running backs this year. It‚Äôs the highest number in the league.Their 59 receptions to backs are second-most in the league as well, illustrating just how pass-catchers have been so successful coming out of the backfield.These numbers have been boosted a bit by facing J.D. McKissic and the Washington Football Team twice ‚Äî McKissic has burned the Giants for 15 catches and 102 yards in two games. But there‚Äôs a reason he got so many targets! In a heavy Cover 3 approach, the Giants‚Äô poor talent at LB is often exposed by pass-catching backs, and they are comfortable taking a sink-and-rally philosophy in their underneath zones that allows for easy, free yardage to running backs on checkdowns.Look no further than Boston Scott, Giant Slayer. Scott‚Äôs three most productive games as a receiver in his career have come against New York‚Äôs defense, and while they‚Äôve added Blake Martinez at LB and switched defensive coordinators since his 2019 performances, his game in Week 8 (three catches, 46 yards, game-winning TD) solidifies the point: the Giants are weak to the RB target.With Miles Sanders returned from injury, expect him to enjoy the soft passing game ground instead of Scott this week. That will not only include screen passes, but the quick angle route the Eagles have been trying to develop with him all season, as well as his usually flares to the flat.It‚Äôs worth noting that there is no pass-catcher Wentz has had more difficulty targeting this year than Sanders, save for perhaps TE Zach Ertz, as he and his explosive running back regularly seem on different pages in regards to spacing and timing. If they can figure that out, the potential for easy stick-movers and big plays alike is there.2.34 - That‚Äôs Daniel Jones‚Äô average time to throw across the last three weeks. It‚Äôs the seventh-fastest figure in the league.That‚Äôs pretty fast, but what matters is how fast it is relative to Jones‚Äô figure earlier in the season. Through the first six weeks of the year, Jones‚Äô time to throw was 2.77 ‚Äî that‚Äôs a whole .33 second different. If one-third of a second doesn‚Äôt sound like a big deal, that 2.77 figure would take Jones from seventh-fastest to eighth-slowest on a list of 40 quarterbacks who have played this year. Big deal.This is an especially big deal when you‚Äôre facing a team like Philadelphia, as regular readers of Bleeding Green will know. The quick passing game is the modern NFL‚Äôs best response to pass rushes that are growing more ferocious by the year. Against teams like Philadelphia in particular, opposing offenses have long sped up their passing game by running half-field reads, RPOs, or constraint plays to get the ball to playmakers before Jim Schwartz‚Äôs ferocious front four can even think about getting to the quarterback.This has held so far this year. When facing quick passing games like Pittsburgh‚Äôs (Roethlisberger‚Äôs 2.13 time to throw is the best in the league), the Eagles couldn‚Äôt pray to cover a quality stable of receivers with their limited secondary talent, and accordingly the pass rush could not have the impact on the game it was paid to generate. Even against the Giants in Week 8 against a reeling offensive line, the Eagles only had three sacks and eight QB hits ‚Äî an average outing against a markedly below-average opponent.Even with slot separator Golden Tate questionable for the game against Philadelphia, the Giants have enough good pass-catchers in Darius Slayton, Sterling Shepard, Evan Engram, and even emerging rookie Austin Mack to find the guys not covered by Darius Slay and work them in a nickel-and-dime passing attack that not only protects Daniel Jones from the Eagles‚Äô pass rush, but also from himself."

He served as the third tight end behind Dallas Goedert and Richard Rogers.The Eagles protecting Wilson again could be a sign that Zach Ertz isn‚Äôt ready to play against the Browns despite the fact that his 21-day practice window was activated. At the very least, the team is preparing for that possibility.It looks like the Eagles are planning to elevate Williams to be the fourth defensive tackle behind Fletcher Cox, Javon Hargrave, and Malik Jackson. Having Williams around gives the Eagles some extra beef to held defend against the Browns‚Äô rushing attack.The Eagles can‚Äôt elevate Arnold to the roster since they‚Äôve already done that twice. Seems like this protection has more to do with making sure no one else poaches him away from Philly.

There are six teams that currently have a 2-7 record, or worse. For any of the 2-7 teams to catch a 4-11-1 Eagles team, they‚Äôd have to win three more games the rest of the way. Maybe the Chargers can pull that off, but that‚Äôs the only real possibility, and it‚Äôs unlikely. So right off the bat, you‚Äôre looking at the seventh overall pick [in the 2021 NFL Draft] as something of a reasonable best case scenario. But then you also need teams like the Bengals, Panthers, Falcons, and Broncos to at least win two more games, and in some cases there, even that doesn‚Äôt feel super likely. There‚Äôs a chance that a 4-11-1 season wouldn‚Äôt even result in a top 10 pick. There are a lot of very, very bad teams in the NFL this year. Because of that, and also because of the added difficulty in scouting players because of the COVID-affected college season, this is probably the worst year to be an awful team, which is what the Eagles are right now.NFL Power Rankings: Week 11 Edition - BGN

21) What would they take back: Not trading for DeAndre Hopkins. The Eagles and Texans discussed a Hopkins trade before he was dealt to the Cardinals. Given the compensation Houston was requesting (apparently greater than the package it accepted from Arizona) and the amount of money the cap-strapped Eagles would have to commit to the wide receiver, they decided to replenish in the draft instead.

The 2010-11 Seahawks offer a glimpse at what a stouthearted (but underwhelming) squad that backs into the playoffs can do. That season, the 7-9 Seahawks did the unthinkable, beating the Saints thanks to a Marshawn Lynch‚Äìcreated Beast Quake. So which of these teams will play that role in the 2020 playoffs? Well, odds still favor the Eagles in the division, despite their 27-17 loss to the Giants this week, and if Philly can continue to get healthier and return more of their core offensive players, they have the look of a team that‚Äôs still capable of pulling some postseason heroics out of their collective asses. But New York made a strong claim for that mantle on Sunday (yes, I will just call this the ‚ÄúTeam Most Capable of Pulling Some Weird Playoff Win Out of Their Asses‚Äù award), dispatching the Eagles thanks to another uncharacteristically clean performance from quarterback Daniel Jones. The second-year quarterback notched his second consecutive turnover-free game this week, which is another big step for a talented passer whose biggest issue thus far has been a distressing, nay, alarming lack of ball security.Dolphins, Browns among teams who made the right choices this offseason - The Athletic
The Bad ‚Äî Philadelphia: The Eagles selected quarterback Jalen Hurts in the second round and claimed that they are in the business of developing quarterbacks while failing to address other needs. With that statement after the draft by Vice President Howie Roseman, the Eagles needed to be proven correct with their team evaluation. So far, Roseman and the Eagles have proven to be way off on their planning for the 2020 season ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not COVID-related. Nothing they have done has improved their football team. From passing on Justin Jefferson to selecting Jalen Reagor, the Eagles‚Äô planning has been dreadful. The Eagles‚Äô front office thought Jefferson was only a slot receiver and Reagor would provide big-play talent. Their willingness to rely on aging players who they know will get injured is somewhat laughable. Why is anyone surprised when an oft-injured older player re-injures himself? The Eagles counted on those players and even though they might win the NFC East, they are not a playoff-caliber team.The Eagles are not good: Assigning blame, plus why Doug Pederson is the key to a turnaround - CBS Sports
The short answer: This is a total team effort. The Eagles, despite your fleeting memories of their magical 2017 title run, have been just clutch enough to hover above mediocrity for two and a half years running. Since Doug Pederson and Nick Foles hoisted the Lombardi Trophy and rewrote Philly sports history, the Birds have gone 22-20-1, including the playoffs. That doesn‚Äôt absolve the 2020 Eagles of their shortcomings, but it speaks to a greater issue: This team‚Äôs warning signs have been pulsing for a while. The emphasis there should be on signs ‚Äî plural. The Eagles are not generally underwhelming because of Carson Wentz. They‚Äôre not generally underwhelming because of Doug Pederson. They‚Äôre not generally underwhelming because of general manager Howie Roseman. They‚Äôre generally underwhelming because of all of them.

The biggest disappointment to me is the poor play of the defense, in particular - Jaylon Smith. We knew coming into this year that there were going to be some growing pains with a defensive coaching makeover, but I couldn‚Äôt have predicted it would be this excruciating. The injuries are plentiful and the team has gotten next to nothing from their free agent acquisitions, but the thing that caught me the most off guard was 54‚Äôs performance. Jaylon just looks like a rookie out there. His reaction is slow, his decision making is sketchy, he‚Äôs often running in the wrong direction, and even when he almost makes a nice play, he ends up getting flagged for some cheap penalty. If it was happening here and there, we could get mad at the officiating, or chalk it up to ‚Äúeveryone makes mistakes.‚Äù However, it‚Äôs a regular thing with him. I love the guy as a person, but his performance combined with the unpredictable health of Leighton Vander Esch has me putting a top collegiate linebacker atop my draft wish list.Giants place Graham Gano on Reserve/COVID-19 list - Big Blue View

The Washington Football Team spoke highly of the fact that their team did not have any players test positive for COVID-19 during the season. Head Coach Ron Rivera attributed it to discipline. Rivera himself was high risk this year as he went through chemo therapy for his cancer diagnosis. It seemed inevitable that a player would test positive during this long season, and that reality has now happened. The team announced today that an undisclosed player has tested positive for COVID-19, and immediately self-isolated after getting the results. His close contacts were also told to quarantine. Update: Matt Ioannidis is the player who tested positive....Social Media Information:BGN Facebook Page: Click here to like our pageBGN Twitter: Follow @BleedingGreenBGN Instagram: Follow @BleedingGreenInstaBGN Manager: Brandon Lee Gowton: Follow @BrandonGowtonBGN Radio Twitter: Follow @BGN_RadioBGN Cameo: Click here for a personalized video message"

Stat to know: Giants QB Daniel Jones has lost 16 straight games against all opponents not named Washington. Part of the problem is obviously turnovers. Jones has 36 since the start of last season, the most in the NFL, and he has had at least one in 20 of 22 career games played. But Wentz is also amid eight consecutive games with a turnover, the longest active streak in the NFL.

An overview:NFL teams are typically only allowed to elevate two practice squad players each week but the Eagles were able to elevate another due to Marcus Epps testing positive for the coronavirus.Let‚Äôs sort through this on a player-by-player basis.We should first point out that the Eagles did NOT announce Seumalo was activated from injured reserve to the roster. They still have until 4:00 PM Eastern today to officially do so but one would think they would‚Äôve announced his activation along with these moves. Doug Pederson said Seumalo was only limited in practice this week so it‚Äôs not exactly like he guaranteed the Eagles‚Äô starting left guard was ready to play.If Seumalo isn‚Äôt activated for the Giants game, the Eagles will likely use this starting offensive line configuration:Left tackle ‚Äî Jason Peters
Left guard ‚Äî Nate Herbig
Center ‚Äî Jason Kelce
Right guard ‚Äî Matt Pryor
Right tackle ‚Äî Lane JohnsonIt‚Äôll be disappointing to see Jordan Mailata on the bench when they can move Peters to replace Pryor, who they clearly don‚Äôt even like much, at right guard.This marks the first time Wilson has been elevated this year. Temporarily adding him to the roster gives the Eagles a third tight end behind Dallas Goedert and Richard Rodgers. Wilson can also help out on special teams.Jacquet seemed to hold up OK while filling in for an injured Darius Slay in Week 8. Of course, it wasn‚Äôt like Ben DiNucci was seriously challenging him. With Craig James out this week, Jacquet‚Äôs elevation gives the Eagles more depth at outside cornerback in addition to special teams help.Fletcher Cox, Malik Jackson, and Javon Hargrave were the only three defensive tackles on the 53-man roster and Jackson was recently banged up. It‚Äôs not surprise, then, that the Eagles wanted to add a fourth defensive tackle. McGill has been cromulent in that role."

To a fault, really, when you consider their over-reliance on former players.In that vein, it‚Äôs probably worth noting that the former Eagles running back Jordan Howard might be available to Philly. The Miami Dolphins waived the 26-year-old on Monday afternoon.There was some thought that the Eagles might re-sign Howard earlier this year after they originally traded for him in March 2019. But he instead signed a two-year, $10 million free agent contract with the Dolphins to presumably be their No. 1 back.Howard immediately struggled to make an impact with his new team. He logged just 11 rushing yards on 13 attempts in his first two starts! It was no surprise to see him eventually phased out of the offense; he‚Äôs averaging an atrociously awful 1.2 yards per carry this year in addition to having one reception for negative three yards. Plus one fumble on just 28 carries.Howard was a positive contributor for the Eagles in 2019 with a 4.4 average and six touchdowns on 119 rushing attempts. But he got phased out in Philly due to the combination of his injury and the emergence on Miles Sanders.And speaking of Sanders, the Eagles should be focused on getting him more touches as opposed to bringing in another back to split them with. It‚Äôs not like the Birds are in desperate need of a No. 2 option with Boston Scott coming off some solid performances. Replacing Corey Clement with Howard would probably be fine but the latter isn‚Äôt going to be counted on to play special teams.The Eagles are currently 19th in the 2021 NFL Draft order, which also doubles as the waiver wire claim order. They‚Äôll have to hope 18 other teams pass on him in order to get him. Of course, it‚Äôs entirely possible that no one claims Howard‚Äôs remaining salary. They might be more interested in signing him at the minimum salary if he clears waivers and becomes a free agent. Or maybe no team will have interest in Howard given how bad he‚Äôs been.The feeling here is the Eagles should pass on bringing him back."

The head coach also addressed the NFL Network report about Carson Wentz‚Äôs practice habits.Pederson admitted early on that the coaches and players are mad and frustrated, and they‚Äôre all disappointed. They know they‚Äôre all so much better than how they played on Sunday, but there‚Äôs a lot of pride in the locker room and they want to finish the season strong.Here‚Äôs what the head coach had to say:‚ÄúWe knew Alshon was coming back, and, listen, we have to make some tough decisions on who‚Äôs up, who‚Äôs down moving forward.‚ÄùMoving forward with Jeffery healthy, they expect his play time will increase each week, but as they construct game day rosters, things will change each week. Pederson noted that it was nothing against JJ Arcega-Whiteside, and they still have a lot of confidence in him. He also pointed out that they have to get more out of the guys that are playing, too.Pederson was asked how he feels he‚Äôs been doing as a play caller and he said that he feels good about the plays that have been called, and even on Sunday, he felt like he was in rhythm ‚Äî noting that he calls plays from the vantage point of a quarterback. He and Carson Wentz communicate about what the QB sees and they go through a bunch of scenarios before games to be prepared that way.He admitted that nobody‚Äôs perfect, and he‚Äôs going to make errors sometimes, but at the same time, Pederson said as to do his job and put the offense in a position to be successful.On Sunday after the loss, however, Pederson said that he was frustrated with himself and was asked to elaborate on that given he feels good about the play calling. The head coach explained that looking back at the loss, it‚Äôs not just about the game, but things like how they used the bye week and their energy. Pederson said that there are things that go on, that as a head coach you have to deal with ‚Äî practice related or off the field issues. And, he even evaluates his own preparation.‚ÄúI look back, and I get frustrated when ‚Äî because, I want every play to work, right. I want every drive to end in a kick, whether it be a field goal or an extra point. And so, when it doesn‚Äôt happen, obviously that‚Äôs where I get a little frustrated and a little upset. What can I do better during the week? How can I coach a little bit better? How can I coach my coaches better? And those are all things I look at, and I can definitely do a better job there.‚ÄùPederson was asked about a report on the NFL Network that the QB‚Äôs practice habits were sloppy, and the head coach had not seen the report and was unsure where that information would come from given the limited media availability during practice. He noted that practice is where they perfect their craft and do things with all the players to detail their work ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs working on fundamentals during individual periods, or even stopping and repeating a play with the whole team on the field.When asked again if Wentz‚Äôs practice habits were sloppy, Pederson simply answered, ‚ÄúNo.‚ÄùPederson was asked about Jalen Hurts and ball security issues, which the head coach did not take kindly, and asked whether they were fumbles or low snaps. He emphasized that those were not Hurts‚Äô issues and they‚Äôve talked to Jason Kelce about having to improve in that area.As far as Hurts‚Äô performance so far this season, Pederson noted that early on they were very explosive with the young QB on the field, and they were getting about 11 or 12 yards per attempt with him in the game. More recently, however, defenses are playing him differently ‚Äî but, he admitted they could probably do a little more with him on the field in the passing game."

This is our new norm, this is our new norm, to be playing football in February.‚ÄùIn that moment, all of Philadelphia believed him. And why not? Pederson had just out-schemed and out-coached Bill Belichick, the greatest head coach in NFL history, on the game‚Äôs greatest stage. Pederson‚Äôs aggressiveness resulted in one of the greatest play calls in Super Bowl history (The Philly Special, of course), and cemented him as one of the best coaches in the league.Confidence in Pederson was sky high.Three years later, Doug Pederson is lost. Unable to construct a cohesive gameplan coming out of their bye week with a roster of offensive playmakers that was as healthy as they‚Äôve ever been, the Eagles went 0-for-9 on third down conversions and managed 17 paltry points against the New York Giants‚Äô 22nd-ranked DVOA defense. Momentum-killing Jalen Hurts plays, the refusal to stick with the running game, and unimaginative play calling that once again looked like random ingredients being thrown into a slow cooker with no semblance of a recipe all reared their ugly heads once again this week.We thought we knew what we had in Doug Pederson. Now, that confidence has been shattered.When Carson Wentz tore up his knee in Week 14 of the NFL season, he was the presumptive MVP favorite. He had a 60.2% completion percentage, he had 33 TDs and 7 INTs in just 13 games, a 101.9 QB rating and displayed a remarkable ability to make the ridiculous plays look routine.Fans were crestfallen after his injury. The season appeared lost, and the city was devastated. But after the knee injury, everything changed. Nick Foles led the team to a Super Bowl and, the following season, another late-season surge and postseason run. Wentz‚Äô teammates constructed a shrine to the back-up. Articles critical of Carson‚Äôs leadership emerged, the offense suffered a deluge of injuries, his QB coach left, and someone in the locker room shared some uncomplimentary thoughts about him to Josina Anderson. Still, Wentz led the team on a four game winning streak to finish 2019 and fans generally felt good about his prospects in 2020.Nine games in the 2020 season, those illusions have been shattered.Wentz has a QB rating of 73.1, 31st out of 33 quarterbacks in the NFL. Only Drew Lock (66.5) and Sam Darnold (65.9) are worse. He‚Äôs 24th out of 30 QBs in Expected Points Added (EPA), and leads the league in interceptions (12) and sacks (35). He‚Äôs not as agile in the pocket, his accuracy has disappeared, and his decision-making has severely regressed.The most disturbing thing about the 2020 Eagles season is that it appears as though the things we thought we knew about the two most important members of the organization, the head coach and franchise quarterback, we no longer know.We don‚Äôt know if Doug Pederson is a quality head coach. We don‚Äôt know if Carson Wentz is a franchise QB. Evidence mounts every week that neither are who we thought they were.Despite the inconsistencies of the defense, a litany of awful drafts, and injuries up and down the roster, it was assumed the competency of Pederson and Wentz would keep the Eagles afloat. Maybe they wouldn‚Äôt be Super Bowl contenders year-in and year-out, but they would at least be a decent football team most weeks, and certainly one that would take advantage of the worst division in modern football history.On Sunday, Wentz wasn‚Äôt awful. He didn‚Äôt turn the ball over and, for the most part, took what the defense gave him. He was mediocre. Unfortunately, mediocre constitutes an improvement for Carson in 2020. That‚Äôs how far the bar has been lowered. The Eagles have little choice but to keep running him out there and hope he gets better.Could they bench him for Jalen Hurts? Sure, and they may have to do that for a spell if Wentz doesn‚Äôt improve, but that creates a hornet‚Äôs nest of issues the organization may not be prepared to handle (though they brought it on themselves by foolishly drafting Hurts in the second round to begin with).How good would Hurts be with an offensive coaching staff that seems to have no answers? The addition of Rich Scangarello has done nothing to help the Eagles become more dynamic. There‚Äôs no excuse for not finding ways to get Dallas Goedert, Miles Sanders, Travis Fulgham and Jalen Reagor the ball in creative ways. Calls for Pederson to relinquish his play-calling duties abound, but if it‚Äôs not Doug, who calls the plays? Scangarello? Press Taylor? Duce Staley? Are those better options? And of course, the Eagles could perhaps have benefitted from hiring an actual offensive coordinator, but if Doug isn‚Äôt the de facto coordinator and isn‚Äôt calling plays, then what is his role? Is he any better than a Jason Garrett 2.0?In September, I wondered if time could actually be running out on Doug Pederson and at the end of the day, I just couldn‚Äôt see how it made sense to fire a Super Bowl winning head coach after what would have essentially been one bad season.Pederson is by no means a perfect coach. The offense has looked stale at times and, let‚Äôs face it, he‚Äôs not great at press conferences. Sometimes Doug gets himself into trouble when he reveals too much or tries to make up a reason for some decision that has been made above his pay grade (such as the Jason Peters-to-left tackle issue this summer).But Pederson is clearly among the best coaches in the NFL. If he were to be dismissed, who would the Eagles hire that could do a better job? We‚Äôve seen so-called ‚Äúgeniuses‚Äù like Sean McVay fail to even reach the postseason one year after going to the Super Bowl (and losing with his offense performing as poorly as any team in Super Bowl history), while Pederson has continued to take his teams to the tournament. Had Wentz not been knocked out of last year‚Äôs wild card game against Seattle on a cheap shot by Jadaveon Clowney, who‚Äôs to say they don‚Äôt beat a flawed Seahawks team and move on to the divisional round?Certainly Pederson needed some help this off-season. Bringing in outside voices was vital, because echo chambers rarely churn out a good product, and adding speed to the offense was critical as well.But even if the offense struggles a bit in 2020, even if the Eagles finish on the outside of the postseason looking in, it would be monumentally short-sighted and stupid of the front office to even consider moving on from Doug Pederson.Two months later, things have changed. No one expected this. Pederson‚Äôs inability to have his team ready to play a terrible football team, in a terrible division, was eye-opening. Yesterday‚Äôs loss was the worst of the Pederson era, a lifeless, listless ‚Äúeffort‚Äù in which every facet of the team was bad. Despite all the ‚ÄúQB Factory‚Äù talk before the season, Wentz‚Äô regression falls, in some part, on the shoulders of the coaching staff, which is headed by Pederson, although Wentz should shoulder a considerable load of the blame, too.Confidence in both men has been shattered and the staggering decline of Wentz and Pederson is terrible news for a franchise that seems farther away from the Super Bowl than it has ever been."

Let‚Äôs get to the questions.I‚Äôve been thinking this since the wheels slowly began to fall off in September: Lincoln Riley, head coach at the University of Oklahoma, is their guy.Why him?Take a look at some excerpts from this Inquirer piece from writer Paul Domowitch that was published in August:The Eagles did a thorough job of scouting Hurts prior to the draft. They watched every snap he played at Alabama and Oklahoma. They talked to his coaches at both schools, including Sooners head coach Lincoln Riley.Roseman and the Eagles have cultivated a good relationship with Riley, who is one of the nation‚Äôs top college coaches.In an interview with the Inquirer in late May, Riley said the Eagles, ‚Äúwere very detailed in the discussions and the homework that they did‚Äô‚Äô on Hurts. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got a plan for him,‚Äô‚Äô he said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a great situation for him.‚ÄùRiley even had some influence in the Eagles‚Äô decision to take TCU wide receiver Jalen Reagor in the first round. Riley had recruited Reagor when he was a high school star at Waxahachie (Texas) High School. His team also played against him for three years in the Big 12. He spoke glowingly of him to Eagles scouts when they talked to him about Hurts. He indicated that Reagor would‚Äôve been a 100-catch-a-year receiver. in Oklahoma‚Äôs offense.That feels like a whole lot of influence on the Eagles‚Äô roster from a guy not affiliated with the team at all, right? I never got the sense that Howie Roseman was Doug Pederson‚Äôs biggest fan. Jeffrey Lurie hired Pederson with the goal of going back to basics with an Andy Reid-type coach and that proved to be a Super success.As things have worsened for the Eagles over the last three seasons, ownership and front office have seemingly been the ones building the coaching staff around Pederson, ultimately resulting in this lackluster cluster of offensive assistants who haven‚Äôt done anything of note this season.I love Doug. Out of Howie Roseman-Carson Wentz-Doug Pederson, triumvirate, I believe Pederson has been the most important aspect of the organization during this era and is the figure I‚Äôd expect to have the greatest level of success elsewhere.Even with all that said, I think he‚Äôs the first one to go when it comes to breaking up this power structure. It isn‚Äôt feasible to move off Wentz‚Äôs contract in 2021. Roseman will forever be Lurie‚Äôs golden boy and it‚Äôs still unclear what type of disaster it would take for Lurie to move on from him as general manager.It pains me to say this, but, yes, I think we‚Äôre reaching the last days of Doug‚Äôs time in Philly. A split may be best for both sides at this point, not unlike Reid‚Äôs departure after the 2012 season.Roseman already has a big time college coach who‚Äôs itching to hit the pro level in his ear. He has a quarterback on the roster he invested major draft capital in with Jalen Hurts, who had a Heisman-worthy campaign in Riley‚Äôs offense in 2019. The writing is on the wall.I get the impression that Pederson is going down with the ship. Maybe he feels the heat and knows the end is nigh and he‚Äôs going to do it his way, calling his own shots to the very last play, but in a vacuum, it could be the exact type of shakeup the Birds‚Äô offsense needs.Reid once did it with Marty Mornhinweg, who is now back as an assistant with the Eagles. He has a ton of play-calling experience. Why not him give him the reins for a game? Why not see if Press Taylor is this rising coaching mind the Eagles questionably believe him to be? Why not let Rich Scangarello recreate the Kyle Shanahan playbook the team was so desperate to replicate?I can‚Äôt see it happening, but it certainly should.I know this, Sean: none of them could beat you out for a starting job for the Prep in the late 2000s.I mean, they can‚Äôt really be the worst of all time, right? It sure does feel like it though.The issue here, as it does with a majority of the Eagles‚Äô problems, lies with Roseman. There‚Äôs a difference between not pouring major resources into the linebacker position, which I agree with, and then not having NFL-caliber players on the roster, which is, surprisingly, very bad news for your team. The Eagles are in the latter situation.Whenever the next front office regime comes into power, not that I think that‚Äôs happening soon, I bet there‚Äôs an overcorrection to a degree. Watch the Eagles take the an off-ball linebacker in the first round once Roseman is removed from power.Carson Palmer is pretty spot on. Palmer had a near MVP-level season in 2005 for the Bengals just as Wentz did in 2017. Both were in their second seasons as starters (Palmer sat out the entirety of the 2003 season as a rookie). Palmer led the league in touchdown percentage, as did Wentz. Both appeared to inject their respective franchises with new blood that would carry them for the next decade-plus.Well, then the injuries happened. On the Bengals‚Äô first pass play in their Wild Card Weekend playoff game, Palmer was hit in the leg after the throw, tearing both his ACL and MCL. He was never the same for Cincinnati. That injury situation sound familiar?Palmer went on to have some success in his mid-30s with Bruce Arians in Arizona, but he never truly became the Prince Who Was Promised for Bengals fans.Maybe Wentz has a rebirth with a second (or third, like Palmer) team down the line, but it just doesn‚Äôt like look we‚Äôre ever getting 2017 Wentz in Philly again.Another guy I considered was Cam Newton for fairly similar reasons. Newton won the MVP award in 2015, leading the Panthers to the Super Bowl. He was good in the next couple years as Carolina‚Äôs starter, but didn‚Äôt get back to his 2015 peak and then the injuries ensued. Newton is now on his second team at age 31 in New England.Hey, the dude‚Äôs 6‚Äô5‚Äù and 220 lbs. with killer acceleration and he‚Äôs one of the best passers in the NBA. Move aside, Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders! The Sixers need to trade for James Harden for my mental well-being so I can survive this craptastic Eagles season.[BLG Note: Co-sign. The Sixers need to get Harden, even if it means trading Ben Simmons.]"

Shout out to the Crown Royal Water Break for making this possible!In handling outside noise...‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a player and you‚Äôre focused on dealing with what the people on the outside are talking about then you‚Äôre doing the wrong thing... To me, if you‚Äôre 3-4-1, your sole focus is how to I be better? How to I perfect my craft?... If you guys were 8-0, people would be talking about you in a positive light, and you shouldn‚Äôt be listening to that either because that‚Äôs how you end up losing games...‚ÄùWhat goes on during the bye...‚ÄúThe most important thing... is the self-scouting. The self-scouting is not just watching the film and saying ‚Äòokay we got to correct these things‚Äô. Self-scouting is much bigger than that... saying ‚Äòokay what are my tendences‚Äô... ‚Äòwhat are the keys we‚Äôre giving off to the defense so that they‚Äôre clueing in on some of our plays‚Äô?The other part is you got to find some creativity... How can you use the plays you‚Äôve already run? Now you want to run different varations of those plays. That‚Äôs something Doug Pederson has to be a little more creative in doing, as far as his playcalls, and a big part of that is getting some of the guys he was going to depend on going into the season back healthy.‚ÄùHow the offense can improve...‚ÄúHow do you play better? Well, you play consistent. What we‚Äôve seen from the quarterback on down, especially offensively, is inconsistent play... If you want this team to turn around right away, one thing you can do is eliminate the turnovers.Carson has to get through his mind that he can‚Äôt win the game on every single throw... punting is okay. Turning the ball over is the problem.‚ÄùOn Miles Sanders in year two...‚ÄúThe most important thing is his health... and quite honestly I struggled with injuries throughout my career. It‚Äôs a lot easier said than done. He has to build that outer core, that outer edge on his body so that he can withstand some of these hits...‚ÄùYou can hear the rest of this BGN Radio Special by listening on the media player below or clicking here if the player doesn‚Äôt load.New to podcasts?!

That‚Äôs not actually so bad, though, since the road team in a game between two relatively even-matched squads is usually given three points.There‚Äôs a case to be made the Browns aren‚Äôt quite as good as their 6-3 record suggests. They only rank 21st in point differential (-28), which is barely ahead of where the Eagles land (-29). Cleveland is also 21st overall when it comes to Football Outsiders‚Äô DVOA metric.The Browns‚Äô resume isn‚Äôt overly impressive when you look at their schedule thus far:WINSWeek 2 ‚Äî vs. Cincinnati Bengals, 35 to 30
Week 3 ‚Äî vs. Washington Football Team, 34 to 20
Week 4 ‚Äî at Dallas Cowboys, 49 to 38
Week 5 ‚Äî vs. Indianapolis Colts, 32 to 23
Week 7 ‚Äî at Cincinnati Bengals, 37 to 34
Week 10 ‚Äî vs. Houston Texans, 10 to 7LOSSESWeek 1 ‚Äî at Baltimore Ravens, 38 to 6
Week 6 ‚Äî at Pittsburgh Steelers, 38 to 7
Week 8 ‚Äî vs. Las Vegas Raiders, 16 to 6The win over the Colts is boast-worthy. Other than that, they‚Äôve racked up wins over bad teams. They mostly haven‚Äôt been able to hang with good ones.Fortunately for the Browns, the Eagles are very much not a good team! Philly ranks 22nd in point differential and 29th in DVOA after recently dropping to 3-5-1.With that said, I do see some reasons for Eagles optimism. The Browns have run the ball at the third highest percentage this season and Jim Schwartz‚Äôs run defense ranks 13th in DVOA. As long as the Browns don‚Äôt give all their carries to non-running backs (quarterbacks and wide receivers), the Eagles might be able to keep Cleveland‚Äôs offense in check. Baker Mayfield isn‚Äôt a sure bet to beat Philly through the air; he‚Äôs been inconsistent with a 90.0 passer rating that ranks 23rd among NFL quarterbacks.It‚Äôs hard to have much faith in the Eagles‚Äô offense right now but Carson Wentz is at least coming off a game where he didn‚Äôt turn the ball over. Maybe he looks a little better against the team that passed on taking him No. 2 overall in the 2016 NFL Draft. Maybe Doug Pederson feeds Miles Sanders more heavily than he has to this point.When I recently did my annual ‚Äúpredict the outcome of the Eagles‚Äô remaining games after the bye‚Äù post, I had the Birds losing to the New York Giants and beating the Browns. Of course, I didn‚Äôt expect them to be quite as listless as they were against the G-Men. And so I don‚Äôt have enough confidence in the Eagles to feel good about them. But I do think the Browns are capable of struggling as well despite their desperation to stay alive in a competitive AFC playoff picture.What say you?"

It was reported at the time that his recovery would take ‚Äúfour-to-six weeks.‚Äù Assuming that timeline is accurate, this week marks the front end of that range. Ergo, Ertz might not actually be ready to play this Sunday against the Cleveland Browns.The #Eagles will see how he looks when he gets back practice this week. Unclear at this point if he‚Äôs got a shot to play Sunday. He‚Äôll have to show them he can move and protect himself on that high-ankle sprain to get clearance. https://t.co/7zGQ6wqWLwFor perspective‚Äôs sake, the Eagles activated Isaac Seumalo‚Äôs window last week and he wasn‚Äôt ready to play against the New York Giants.It remains to be seen how much Ertz‚Äôs return will actually help Philly‚Äôs struggling offense. He wasn‚Äôt exactly playing well prior to getting hurt! Wentz and Ertz clearly weren‚Äôt on the same page as the veteran tight end saw 45 targets for just 24 receptions, 178 yards (paltry 7.4 average), and one touchdown.Ertz‚Äôs return would mean a decreased role for Richard Rodgers, who has been surprisingly productive for the Eagles. Dick Rod actually ranks third on the team in receiving yards with 244 on 23 receptions.That the Eagles opened Ertz‚Äôs window means they expect him back at some point in the near future. Maybe Wentz and him can rekindle their strong connection. Or maybe it‚Äôs just more of the same from earlier this year with Ertz operating at less than 100%.James was placed on IR for the second time this year. He previously missed time due to a hamstring injury. James was a full participant in last Wednesday‚Äôs practice coming out of the bye but then he missed the next two days with a shoulder issue. Must have gotten hurt in practice somehow.James being out for the year hurts the Eagles‚Äô corner depth. Also bad for Dave Fipp‚Äôs unit to be missing a special teams co-captain. Perhaps the Eagles will look to sign practice squad cornerback Michael Jacquet to the roster to take his place.Or they could use the open spot to activate the aforementioned Seumalo if he‚Äôs ready for this week‚Äôs game."

Including whomever urged NFL Network‚Äôs Mike Silver to share the following about Doug Pederson and Carson Wentz:The @Eagles' offense is a mess right now, and Doug Pederson may be listening to too many voices. From GameDay Final on @nflnetwork pic.twitter.com/jBAdjZKV5WTranscript:‚ÄúDoug Pederson is extremely well-liked in that building but the facts are facts. They‚Äôve been starting slowly. The offense lacks rhythm or cohesion, seems to been in a rut. And I think if it continues, all options are on the table. There‚Äôs a feeling that Pederson may be listening to too many voices. There are a lot of offensive assistants on that staff and Pederson is amendable to their suggestions. The game plan doesn‚Äôt fit together. And even the voices in his headset, on the analytics side, you saw today they got to within 21-17 in the third quarter, they went for two, what seemed to be an analytics decision, didn‚Äôt make it, and all of a sudden were down more than a field goal. So a lot of frustrations swirling in the air in that building.The idea that there are ‚Äútoo many cooks in the kitchen‚Äù was one that was raised at the time of the Eagles finalizing their 2020 coaching staff hires. This offense has sorely lacked an identity all season long.Pederson ultimately deserves a lot of blame, to be sure, but one can wonder how much control he truly has over his staff. He didn‚Äôt want to get rid of his former offensive coordinator, which was a problem, but he was forced to do so. Is it unthinkable, then, that new coaching staff hires were forced upon him in some capacity?Regardless, Pederson hasn‚Äôt found a way to make it all work. He doesn‚Äôt have answers right now and it‚Äôs a big problem.What's up with Carson Wentz... and is he definitely the Eagles' quarterback of the future? I assessed the situation with @ChrisRose on GameDay Final @nflnetwork pic.twitter.com/aWql9A4zcrTranscript:‚ÄúCarson Wentz this season is a far cry from the guy who was tearing it up in the first part of 2017. There are some sloppy practice habits that he‚Äôs been allowed to perpetuate, that have carried over, not checking the ball down or knowing when to give up on a play, forcing the ball to predetermined receivers, and maybe overestimating his once elite athleticism. And, look, they drafted Jalen Hurts in the second round. That was clearly a signal that they are not necessarily standing pat at that position. So, I think, organizationally, they would like to continue to build this around Carson Wentz, but if this downward spirals, there‚Äôs a sense that it could all be blown up.‚ÄùThe line about ‚Äúsloppy practice habits‚Äù is concerning. Pederson predictably denied that characterization on Monday but, if it‚Äôs true, that‚Äôs clearly an indictment of Wentz. It‚Äôs also an indictment of quarterbacks coach Press Taylor, whose effectiveness has been questioned here for some time now. It‚Äôs hard not to think there‚Äôs a serious lack of accountability and tough love.Pederson and Wentz can quiet this chatter by finding a way to turn things around. But it‚Äôs hard to have confidence in them doing that right now. And thus the leaks may only continue."

While I'm not one to really cater to conspiracies, this is a thought that has been with me for the last few weeks. My inability to shake it has led me here.Whenever the Eagles run the Hurts package, what's the one thing that never happens?Wentz leaving the field.It's gotten to the point it's visibly forced. One can't help but feel this is the Eagle catering to Wentz on an emotional level. Never giving him the feeling he isn't in control of the team. Almost trying to over reassure him. Not taking Wentz off the field when Hurts comes in, signifies that this is ""just"" a gadget play and Wentz is still in control.Never giving Hurts a chance to fully run the offense ,even on package plays, also veils the world from seeing what he could potentially do without being handicapped a WR. Thus preventing any real possibility of a true quarterback controversy. It's hard to come up with another explanation as to why Wentz never leaves the field for those plays. Even the Saints have Brees leave the field sometimes when Taysom Hill comes in. A player comparison that arose from within the organization shortly after Hurts was drafted.It's difficult to see the Eagles continuously do this ,even after consistent failure, and not feel like this is the most visible indicator of something more concerning occurring within the organization.I don't want to dive too deep down a rabbit hole here but I felt the need to share this thought and I'm interested to see if others get a similar impression."

Pittsburgh is eyeing their seventh Vince Lombardi Trophy.2 - Kansas City Chiefs (LW: 2) - The Chiefs return from their bye to face a Las Vegas team that beat them earlier this season.3 - New Orleans Saints (LW: 3) - On the bright side, they‚Äôre 7-2 after six straight wins. On the dark side, Drew Brees will miss ‚Äúsome time‚Äù after suffering broken ribs and a lung collapse. It‚Äôll be interesting to see what Jameis Winston can do until Brees returns. Winnable games up next: vs. ATL, at DEN, vs. ATL.4 - Green Bay Packers (LW: 6) - The Packers only won by four points despite being 14-point favorites. They‚Äôre 7-2 and pretty good ‚Ä¶ but not flat out elite. Only eighth in DVOA and ninth in point differential.5 - Miami Dolphins (LW: 10) - The Dolphins are awesome. They‚Äôve won five in a row and they rank fifth in point differential. The quarterback switch from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Tua Tagovailoa has clearly worked out so far; the rookie is playing well. Legitimate threat to win the AFC East! They also currently have a top six pick in the 2021 NFL Draft thanks to Houston being bad.6 - Tampa Bay Buccaneers (LW: 9) - Tom Brady has a history of bouncing back from really bad losses. That‚Äôs exactly what he did against Carolina.7 - Arizona Cardinals (LW: 11) - I‚Äôm beginning to think the Cardinals may have won the DeAndre Hopkins trade. This big win has Arizona in the NFC West lead.This is why you trade for DeAndre Hopkins

(and why you don't trade him away ) pic.twitter.com/cesPQe27PO8 - Buffalo Bills (LW: 8) - Pretty tough to lose on a Hail Mary like that. That defeat probably ended their shot at a top two seed in the AFC playoff picture. And their spot atop their division is less secure with Miami on the rise.9 - Baltimore Ravens (LW: 4) - The offense continues to not look right. The Ravens are 4-3 in their last seven games and Lamar Jackson has a 85.9 passer rating in that span. Losing to the Pats likely ended any hope of winning the AFC North.10 - Los Angeles Rams (LW: 12) - The Rams‚Äô defense is very good. They‚Äôve allowed just 16.4 offensive points per game, fewest in the NFL. Los Angeles will at least be a wild card team and they‚Äôre in the mix for the NFC West crown.11 - Seattle Seahawks (LW: 5) - The Seahawks are 1-3 in their last four games. Russell Wilson has 10 turnovers in that span. The guy who looked like the NFL‚Äôs MVP earlier in the season has to be better than that.12 - Las Vegas Raiders (LW: 13) - Jon Gruden has led the Raiders to three straight wins. Can they now beat KC twice in one season? Big test ahead.13 - Indianapolis Colts (LW: 14) - Big win for the Colts on Thursday Night Football to take the lead in the AFC South. That defense is really solid and Philip Rivers is playing his best ball recently. He‚Äôs got a nice weapon in Nyheim Hines.14 - Tennessee Titans (LW: 7) - The Titans are 1-3 in their last four games. Stephen Gostkowski‚Äôs eight field goal misses and two extra point misses have contributed to a team that ranks 30th in special teams DVOA.15 - Cleveland Browns (LW: 15) - Things haven‚Äôt been pretty for the Browns lately but they‚Äôre in the hunt for a playoff spot at 6-3.

Kirk Cousins FINALLY got a win on Monday Night Football, bringing him up to 1-9 in his career. Naturally, it was achieved with no fans in the stands. Justin Jefferson is now up to four 100+ yards out of nine in his career. He‚Äôs kinda good.17 - New England Patriots (LW: 23) - Very good win over Baltimore after barely beating NYJ last week. They have ground to make up but the Pats‚Äô season isn‚Äôt necessarily over yet.18 - Carolina Panthers (LW: 17) - The Panthers have lost five in a row but this has been an overall encouraging season for them. Shame that Teddy Bridgewater got hurt but not the worst thing in the world for the Panthers to potentially get a look at XFL superstar P.J. Walker.19 - Cincinnati Bengals (LW: 18) - Joe Burrow will lead the Bengals to victory over Pittsburgh some day in the future ‚Ä¶ but not now. A team that finished with the No. 1 overall pick last year still needs to be infused with more talent.20 - Chicago Bears (LW: 19) - Let‚Äôs all hope Nick Foles isn‚Äôt seriously hurt and can get back soon. But he might not be playing even if healthy considering the Bears are now 2-5 with him as their starter. We could soon see Foles replaced by Mitchell Trubisky.21 - Detroit Lions (LW: 24) - Does Matt Patricia get fired if the Lions don‚Äôt end up recovering from a big blown lead? He continues to narrowly avoid his inevitable termination.22 - Los Angeles Chargers (LW: 21) - The Bolts need a new coaching staff. Should be a pretty attractive job with Justin Herbert in place.23 - New York Giants (LW: 27) - The Giants beating Philly for the first time since 2016 qualifies as a signature win for Joe Judge. The rookie head coach might actually be able to lead the G-Men to winning the NFC East.24 - San Francisco 49ers (LW: 20) - I think it‚Äôs safe to say the 49ers aren‚Äôt going very far with Nick Mullens under center.25 - Atlanta Falcons (LW: 25) - The Falcons return from their bye to play on the road in New Orleans. They‚Äôll be 3-7 if they can‚Äôt pull off the upset.26 - Philadelphia Eagles (LW: 22) - The Eagles have serious issues when it comes to their quarterback, coaching staff, and front office. Their foundation is hardly as solid as it was once thought to be.27 - Denver Broncos (LW: 26) - Drew Lock has thrown seven touchdowns to 10 interceptions this season. Maybe he can further develop into an OK backup but the Broncos need to find a legitimate long-term starter.28 - Houston Texans (LW: 28) - Deshaun Watson has a 107.0 passer rating this season. That the Texans are only 2-7 speaks to how flawed everything is around him.29 - Washington Football Team (LW: 29) - Alex Smith almost led the Football Team to a big comeback win after being down by 21 points halfway through the third quarter. Despite their loss, Washington still has hope to win the NFC East. Which is crazy because they‚Äôd be picking third overall if the season ended today.30 - Dallas Cowboys (LW: 30) - The Cowboys return from their bye to travel to Minnesota. Dallas could be looking at dropping to 2-8.31 - Jacksonville Jaguars (LW: 31) - The Jags gave good effort in a close loss to Green Bay. Perfect tanking result. Currently on track for the No. 2 pick.32 - New York Jets (LW: 32) - The Jets return from their bye to face LAC on the road. Must-lose game to maintain their chances of landing the No. 1 overall pick."

Whether it‚Äôs Pederson‚Äôs inability to get this team ready at the start of games, his failure to get Carson Wentz turned around, his bizarre in-game decisions, his terrible play-calling, Pederson right now is just really bad at coaching the Eagles. They‚Äôre never ready. Down 14-3 to the Rams. Down 17-0 to the Ravens. Down 9-7 to Ben Freaking DiNucci and the Cowboys. Down 13-3 in the first Giants game. Down 14-3 on Sunday. They never play well on both sides of the ball at the same time. They don‚Äôt run the ball enough. They don‚Äôt get takeaways. They can‚Äôt sustain any offensive rhythm. Their defense always seems to give up a touchdown when the offense finally gets something going. Their once-borderline-MVP quarterback stinks. Week after week after week.

Worst Doug Pederson game I can remember. Didn‚Äôt take some fourth downs he should have, didn‚Äôt call plays on third down to set up fourth down, made a wanton decision to go for a 2-point conversion down 4, and most importantly, brought a flat, unchanged, uninspired, rusty team out of the bye week for the fourth time in his career. Isn‚Äôt he pissed? Isn‚Äôt he tired of this? Doesn‚Äôt he want his job to be easier? The offense is panicky, afraid of its own quarterback, dedicated to Richard Rodgers and Greg Ward while Travis Fulgham and Dallas Goedert fall useless to the wayside. Pederson has failed to integrate any new ideas into the offense and regularly limits the existing offense with a the caricuture of freshness and ingenuity that is a Jalen Hurts power read. This is an aimless coaching staff.The Kist & Solak Show #207: Throw the Chairs, Eagles Lose to Giants - BGN Radio

The biggest criticism of Carson Wentz so far this season has been that Wentz has tried to play ‚Äúhero ball,‚Äù as in, trying to play hero by attempting to make impossible plays that just aren‚Äôt there, and committing crippling turnovers as a result. Well, he certainly didn‚Äôt play hero ball on Sunday! He threw the ball away when necessary, and the Eagles punted a lot instead of fumbling or throwing interceptions. Wentz is unquestionably part of the problem, as he has very clearly been a bottom 10 (if we‚Äôre being kind) quarterback this season. But the issues with this Eagles offense go beyond just Wentz, who isn‚Äôt being put in a position to succeed.Same Old Song and Dance - Iggles Blitz
The offense did not have a third down conversion in the game. Not one. The last time that happened was November of 2004 against the Steelers. That would be a big problem in any game, but it was magnified due to the Eagles poor field position. They didn‚Äôt have any drive start beyond their own 25-yard line. They had six drives start inside the 20. Ugh. The defense was awful in the first quarter, giving up 148 yards. They did settle down, but didn‚Äôt make any big plays and the Giants moved the ball on them at key moments in the game. Special teams was a problem area, once again. This was a team loss.Would the Eagles be better off if they fail to win the NFC East and bottom out? - The Ahletic
The fan base is beholden to no such myopia. Over the first nine games, the Eagles‚Äô bewildering sloppiness has laid bare a poorly constructed roster that is also underachieving and dangerously close to turning fan outrage into apathy. It‚Äôs fair to wonder whether the organization would be better off long term if it isn‚Äôt able to win the NFC East title no one deserves. The case for rooting against something like a 6-9-1 division title is about shocking the Eagles into making the kind of structural change they need. The reworked offensive coaching staff has produced one of the league‚Äôs least-creative offenses while a defense built to play Jim Schwartz‚Äôs desired scheme has underwhelmed in predictable ways (the linebackers are bad) and unpredictable ways (three highly paid defensive tackles do not, in fact, guarantee dominance at the line of scrimmage). Meanwhile, the roster construction of a team built on the foundation of highly paid players on the wrong side of 30 is crumbling and offers little salary cap relief in sight. To say nothing of the draft-pick consequences of making an empty playoff appearance (picking 19th in every round as opposed to somewhere near 10th), change is necessary, and losing would necessitate change.Why the Cardinals Believed Kyler Murray‚Äôs Hail Mary to DeAndre Hopkins Was Possible - MMQB
The Eagles feel less like first-place team than any I can remember. Yes, a big part of that is the fact that the NFC East is as bad a division as we‚Äôve had in recent memory. But it‚Äôs not just that‚ÄîPhilly‚Äôs 3‚Äì5‚Äì1, its young quarterback looks lost way too often, the offensive line‚Äôs been shredded by injuries and the defense isn‚Äôt quite good enough to make up for all that. This stuck out to me too, from Doug Pederson postgame: ‚ÄúI felt like the guys were ready to go, I‚Äôm obviously disappointed, that‚Äôs on me the way we played today. Quite honestly, I felt the energy was good, it‚Äôs difficult obviously without the fans, but that is both teams to deal with it.‚Äù Credit to Pederson for taking the blame, but it sure feels like more change is coming here. And you have to wonder what will happen with the offensive staff going forward. Last offseason, the Eagles went through a second overhaul in that area, since losing OC Frank Reich and QBs coach John DeFilippo in early 2018. Mike Groh was fired and the team made runs at Chiefs QBs coach Mike Kafka, Cowboys OC Kellen Moore and Ohio State receivers coach Brian Hartline, before settling on hiring Rich Scangarello, pairing him with Press Taylor and leaving the OC title vacant. Could Philly fill it this offseason? Based on how all this is going, I wouldn‚Äôt rule it out.NFL Week 10 PFF ReFocused: New York Giants 27, Philadelphia Eagles 17 - PFF
Daniel Jones has graded as a better quarterback than Carson Wentz this season coming into the week, and that gap is only going to grow after this one. [...] The Eagles, meanwhile, averaged nearly 7.0 yards per attempt on the ground with an efficient day from Miles Sanders and a long touchdown run from Boston Scott, but inaccuracy from Wentz kept their offense from really rolling. He completed just 57% of his passes, and you can‚Äôt point to drops by his receivers as the reasoning for it. Injuries around him didn‚Äôt help, but it‚Äôs hard to say that Wentz‚Äôs play hasn‚Äôt held this team back this year.Week 10: Inside The Hail Murray And How The Cardinals Got It Done - FMIA
I think sometimes a head coach makes a call to try to either show his team he trusts them even though he shouldn‚Äôt, or because he‚Äôs trying to shake them out of their skid. Whatever, Doug Pederson going for two with 20 minutes left in the game and down to the Giants by four points was an absurd strategic decision Sunday. (It failed.) Why‚Äôd he do it? My guess: to light a spark under one of the worst quarterbacks in football right now, Carson Wentz. From his 2018 to 2020 numbers, Wentz is down 11 completion-percentage points and 29 passer-rating points; he was plus-14 in TD-to-INT margin, and this year he‚Äôs thrown 12 TDs and 12 picks. His line‚Äôs not helping, but Wentz is giving the Eagles significant reason to question his huge contract.Carson Wentz, Eagles receivers still struggling with chemistry in Giants loss - Inquirer
To no surprise, the Eagles finally activated Jeffery Sunday. While that doesn‚Äôt forgive the inexcusable eight weeks they wasted with the receiver on the 53-man roster, it seemed as if the team would finally get something from its $16 million receiver. But Jeffery played sparingly and was targeted only once ‚Äî an early Wentz pass that sailed over his outstretched hands. Was it worth not dressing youngsters JJ Arcega-Whiteside and Quez Watkins? Perhaps. It‚Äôs not like either has earned a role. The decision, though, all but seals what has been apparent about Arcega-Whiteside: The Eagles don‚Äôt believe the second-year receiver is worth developing. Twenty-four games is fairly quick to pull the cane on a second-round draft pick, but Arcega-Whiteside has just 12 catches over that span. He can‚Äôt even be trusted to play on special teams.Eagles fall at New York to open season‚Äôs second half - PE.com
1. The offense failed to convert a third down as drive after drive stalled. For the first time since the 2004 season ‚Äì November 7, 2004 at the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 27-3 loss ‚Äì the Eagles didn‚Äôt convert on third down. They were 0-for-9 on Sunday (one of their third downs was converted on a Giants pass interference penalty in the second quarter). ‚ÄúToo many third-and-longs,‚Äù Head Coach Doug Pederson said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to overcome. We‚Äôve got to do a better job on first and second down. Too many third-and-longs.‚Äù The ledger on the distance on third down for the offense ‚Äì 1, 3, 1, 4 (converted via penalty), 11, 14, 11, 18, 10, 10. The average (not counting the penalty conversion): third-and-9.How the scores from the bye week affected the Cowboys - Blogging The Boys
Given what happened with the Football Team, Wentz now is probably no better than the third-best starting QB, depending on how you view Andy Dalton. Or Garrett Gilbert, if Dalton is not able to go against the Minnesota Vikings. Heck, Wentz may just be number five out of four teams. (I will refrain from the Jalen Hurts jokes, because the Eagles seem committed to only using him as a wildcat type player, which so far has been a dismal flop.)Washington‚Äôs comeback falls short; Lions win 30-27 - Hogs Haven
Alex Smith just had his first back-to-back 300 yard passing games in his career. He finished his first start in 728 days with a 38/55 390 yard stat line. J.D. McKissic scored his first TD since 2017, and Antonio Gibson scored twice. Washington entered the 2nd half with in a 17-3 hole following another 1st half filled with missed opportunities. They tied it up with under a minute to go in a game that looked like it was going to overtime. Matthew Stafford wasn‚Äôt having that, and he got them in field goal range with the help of a Chase Young roughing the passer penalty. Matt Prater finished it off with a 59 yard FG.The Winners and Losers of NFL Week 10 - The Ringer
Everything‚Äôs setting up well: The 3-5-1 Eagles are still leading the division, and the 3-7 Giants are now in second place, just a game back. The dream scenario of a 4-11-1 division champion is still alive (and, honestly, not that implausible). The Eagles need to finish the season at 1-6‚Äîand considering they‚Äôre playing terribly and five of their final seven games are against teams currently above .500, that‚Äôs entirely possible. The rest of the NFC East also needs to continue sucking‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to be particularly tough. It‚Äôs not that uncommon for a division to have three bad teams and one competent team that feasts off them en route to a playoff berth. What makes the NFC East special is that there‚Äôs no one team capable of doing that. It‚Äôs bad from head to toes, which is why its head is lower than Kyler Murray‚Äôs shoulders.How the NFL playoff picture looks coming out of Week 10 - DraftKings Nation
The biggest wins of Week 10 go to the Cardinals on a Hail Mary against the Bills and the Rams, who held off the Seahawks at home. The low key valuable win might have been the Giants beating the Eagles with relative ease. Philly remains in first place in the NFC East, but the 3-7 Giants are suddenly within spitting distance of the 3-5-1 Eagles!DeAndre Hopkins snatched a Hail Mary away from 3 Bills defenders to win the game - SB Nation
The Arizona Cardinals were down to their final play against Buffalo Bills in Week 9. After trailing 23-9 early in the second half, the Cardinals stormed back behind quarterback Kyler Murray to take the lead. Just when Arizona‚Äôs offense thought it had won the game, the defense let Buffalo march down the field and surrendered the go-ahead touchdown on a 12-play, 78-yard drive that ended in a Josh Allen strike to Stefon Diggs. After the ensuing kickoff went for a touchback, the Cardinals were trailing by two points with 34 seconds left. Fortunately, Murray had a little more magic left. The QB launched a Hail Mary to DeAndre Hopkins, who made a spectacular catch to win the game between three Buffalo defenders. You might not see a better ending all year. [BLG Note: Good thing the Eagles didn‚Äôt trade for Hopkins! Or Diggs, for that matter.]...Social Media Information:BGN Facebook Page: Click here to like our pageBGN Twitter: Follow @BleedingGreenBGN Instagram: Follow @BleedingGreenInstaBGN Manager: Brandon Lee Gowton: Follow @BrandonGowtonBGN Radio Twitter: Follow @BGN_RadioBGN Cameo: Click here for a personalized video message"

The Birds actually gained ground in the NFC East and they managed to get good news on the injury front. As such, SB Nation Reacts polling data shows fan confidence increased from 24% to 31%:While I do think there are reasons for optimism about the Eagles‚Äô second half, I also think distance from the team‚Äôs last game factors into the confidence boost.

The New York Giants are all the way up at 74% despite their 2-7 record:The bar for ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù has clearly been lowered in North Jersey but Giants fans do have some reason to feel encouraged about how this season has gone. The team is fighting hard for Joe Judge. A win over the Eagles would probably have fans feeling great considering their last one came back in 2016.The Washington Football Team saw a decrease in fan confidence following their Week 9 loss to the Giants. They dropped from 67% to 61%:Alex Smith is set to make his first start since the 2018 season against the Detroit Lions this week. A win keeps Washington alive for the division crown.The Dallas Cowboys almost pulled off a big upset over the Pittsburgh Steelers last weekend. No surprise to see their fan confidence shoot up from 12% to 27%:The Dallas defense has been more respectable in recent weeks and there‚Äôs some hope that Garrett Gilbert might be at least a competent quarterback.

To suggest Wentz‚Äôs decline is tied to the coaching he‚Äôs getting is largely disingenuous. Are we to believe that Pederson, who helped make Nick Foles look like Joe Montana for consecutive seasons, suddenly forgot how to coach quarterbacks or scheme up an offense? Are we now going to rewrite history and say that was only Reich and DeFilippo‚Äôs doing? Please. And what other quarterbacks get such benefit of the doubt? Do we grade the play of Detroit‚Äôs Matthew Stafford or Atlanta‚Äôs Matt Ryan or Pittsburgh‚Äôs Ben Roethlisberger based on the coaching triumvirate around them, or is there a baseline expectation regardless of extenuating circumstances? Yes, there are other reasons why the Eagles are stumbling, ranging from injuries to coaching to porous defensive play to an ever-rotating supporting cast around Wentz. But top-end quarterbacks are the balm for such maladies. That is precisely why they get paid so handsomely.4 winners and 3 losers from Week 10 in the NFL - SB Nation
The biggest single reason Philadelphia is struggling isn‚Äôt attributable wholly to Ertz being out. It‚Äôs that Wentz has suffered out of the most pronounced performance declines in recent memory. The cruel twist of all this is that running back Miles Sanders is playing much better than he did in 2019, improving his yards-per-carry up to 6.1 on the season, second in the league among running backs only to Nick Chubb. This is something the Eagles should have been able to capitalize on, but they haven‚Äôt been able to put a solid offense together ‚Äî ranking in the bottom third in yards per game, and points per game. In short: The Eagles had so much promise this season, and instead are basically Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes.Week 10 Quick Reads - Football Outsiders
QB27 ‚Äî Wentz loses 48 DYAR due to opponent adjustments. He was the week‚Äôs worst passer on third downs, going 2-of-9 for 21 yards, plus a 14-yard DPI, with as many conversions (two) as sacks.6 final thoughts from the Eagles‚Äô pathetic loss to the Giants - BGN
The Eagles deserve your indifference more than your anger. Look, I‚Äôm not incentivized to say this since I only stand to suffer from you tuning out of our coverage ... but I honestly feel like this team isn‚Äôt worth your emotional investment right now. I can‚Äôt possibly blame anyone for checking out. The Eagles are predictably bad each week. They‚Äôre not fun or enjoyable in any capacity. And, worst of all, it doesn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. This season feels like a big waste of time in that regard. There will obviously be some changes in the offseason if things continue to go poorly but I just don‚Äôt have confidence they‚Äôll be serious enough. Howie Roseman doesn‚Äôt appear to be in any danger. Doug Pederson probably gets at least one more year after giving up play-calling duties. Carson Wentz‚Äôs contract has him locked in through at least 2021. The health of this franchise just isn‚Äôt good. This isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúone down year.‚Äù We‚Äôve been talking about how things have been trending poorly downwards for some time now.At the Podium: Post-Giants Loss w/Doug & Carson - BGN Radio
Doug Pederson and Carson Wentz fielded questions from the media on Sunday after the Eagles 27-17 loss to the New York Giants, listen to them here!Troubling Times - Iggles Blitz
Watching the Eagles every week is painful. This isn‚Äôt a fun team. They lack talent, discipline and there‚Äôs nothing compelling about them. The Giants are just 3-7, but you come away impressed with how hard they play and the way they compete. They have major roster holes, but that group feels well-coached and they seem to be a team on the rise. You can argue that some of that is due to having the new coaching staff. That brings a different energy to the team. Look at the Patriots. They have plenty of holes and they are 4-5. But they still battle each week and have some impressive games this year. They just upset the Ravens on Sunday night. Their problem is purely talent. They lost too many good players in the offseason and then had the most guys in the league opt out due to Covid.It‚Äôs time for Eagles coach Doug Pederson to stop babying Carson Wentz - Inquirer
Doug Pederson‚Äôs biggest problem is Carson Wentz; specifically, his handling of the quarterback. The Eagles coach manages Wentz like he‚Äôs won Super Bowls, when in fact he‚Äôs yet to even win a playoff game. He coaches him like he‚Äôs the 2017 version of himself, who went 11-2 as a starter, and not the one who‚Äôs gone 17-18-1 since. Pederson‚Äôs staff decisions, his offensive scheming and play-calling, his use of Jalen Hurts, and his messaging are too often in deference to Wentz. The 27-year-old quarterback‚Äôs preferences should be considered, but not at the expense of the team, and not to the point where there has been significant individual regression. Wentz, of course, must shoulder his share of culpability for his and the Eagles‚Äô woeful play through nine games this season. This isn‚Äôt a chicken-or-egg argument. Both the coach and quarterback are responsible for the 3-5-1 record, as are the front office, assistants, and other players. But of all the problems plaguing the Eagles ‚Äî from personnel to injuries, from coaching to execution ‚Äî the most troubling is Wentz. He has yet to have what could be described as a good outing, and even when he finally avoided turning the ball over, as he did in Sunday‚Äôs 27-17 loss at the New York Giants, he was merely adequate.Eagles stuck between being division leaders and a youth movement - NBCSP
Jason Peters is 38. He has no future here. Alshon Jeffery is 30. He has no future here. But if you thought that maybe the Eagles would prioritize a youth movement over playing their aging veterans, then Doug Pederson crushed your dreams within the span of 15 minutes during his Monday afternoon press conference. Because Peters is staying at left tackle. And Jeffery‚Äôs snaps are going to increase. The Eagles, at 3-5-1, are in a position no team this bad has ever been in: In first place after 10 games. And that‚Äôs creating some natural strain. Because on one hand, the Eagles are a bad football team and they should prioritize getting their younger players more experience. On the other, Pederson is trying to win the division and he‚Äôs playing the guys he thinks give them the best shot. Let‚Äôs start with Jeffery. The Eagles were stuck with the veteran receiver in 2020 after Howie Roseman foolishly decided to guarantee his contract. They wanted to trade him but ‚Äî shocker! ‚Äî there were no takers. Jeffery was a waste of a roster spot for the first eight weeks of the season but finally made his debut on Sunday.Doug Pederson‚Äôs disconnect: Discussing his play calling, coaching, job security - The Athletic
I think you‚Äôre right that the changes to the offensive coaching staff this past offseason tell us what we need to know about how Lurie adjudicated the problems with the offense, and I would imagine he‚Äôs pretty unimpressed with the early returns. As for who‚Äôs most responsible for the state of the team, all three are definitely culpable. Take Wentz‚Äôs regression. He should be blamed for backsliding, but it‚Äôs hard from where we sit to determine how much of that could have been avoided by better coaching or by having a competent supporting cast. In the end, the buck should stop with the person molding the roster. We‚Äôve talked ad nauseam about the Eagles having an old, mediocre, expensive roster, and the blame for that falls on Roseman.Doug Pederson: ‚ÄòI do want the guys to feel that emotion‚Äô - PE.com
First things first: Pederson wants a particular environment this week. He knows the locker room expressed its frustration in the postgame scene on Sunday. He knows how the players reacted. And Pederson wants that emotion to carry forward to this week when the players report back to the NovaCare Complex and prepare for Cleveland. It‚Äôs going to take great emotion and focus and execution to beat the Browns, a team with a punishing running game offensively and a defensive front to be reckoned with. The Browns are for real. They‚Äôve won by outscoring teams (like Dallas) and by outslugging teams (like Houston on Sunday, a 10-7 victory). ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a mood where, I don‚Äôt want it to be a panic mood by any stretch of the imagination,‚Äù Pederson said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any of that, but I do want the guys to feel that emotion they felt after the game and feel that sort of anger, that ‚Äòmad‚Äô feeling they had and channel that for good, channel that for their week of preparation. I talk to the team a lot about preparation and hard work and you can‚Äôt substitute for that. The way you practice is the way you‚Äôre going to play and we‚Äôve got to focus on that and take care of the details during the week.‚ÄùPlayoffs? Yes, the New York Giants really do have a chance - Big Blue View
Can the New York Giants really go from 0-5 to division champions in the NFC East, the league‚Äôs weakest division? It‚Äôs still not likely after the Giants‚Äô victory Sunday over the Philadelphia Eagles. The Eagles still have the lead in the division, they have one more game to play than the Giants do, and their tie with the Cincinnati Bengals might end up being a difference-maker. Winning the division, though, is within the Giants‚Äô reach. Football Outsiders gives the Giants a 26.5 percent chance of winning the division, with the Eagles still at 48.5 percent.With a great draft spot, a new quarterback is tempting, but the right move is to pay Dak Prescott - Blogging The Boys
If the Cowboys intended to use their first-round pick on a quarterback, then they would need to find a way to trade Prescott to avoid just flat out losing him after the 2021 season. The optimal scenario would be deal him away to another team that really wants Dak as their quarterback. There would be a lot of behind the scenes negotiations as well as financial finagling going on to swing such a deal, but if they pulled it off, here is what the Cowboys would gain: Future draft capital, including at least one first-round pick. Estimated cap savings of $31 million per year over the next four seasons.Washington Vs. Detroit - Studs and Duds - Hogs Haven
Alex Smith - I mean, I guess I kinda have to do this. Despite the MULTIPLE checkdowns, and the fact he now leads the league in percentage of passes thrown as checkdowns, Alex did get a bit looser in the second half and started to take some shots down the field. I think it‚Äôs TERRIBLE that we had to throw the ball 55 times, but despite that(and all the checkdowns) he did complete 38 of those passes(69% completion percentage) for 390 yards. He threw for zero touchdowns, but didn‚Äôt turn the ball over, and if it wasn‚Äôt for a bone-headed penalty at the end of the game, we would have gone into overtime with a shot at winning.Bears QB Nick Foles carted off in final moments of ‚ÄòMNF‚Äô loss vs. Vikings - NFL.com
In a matter of seconds, the Bears went from a team hellbent on avoiding another crushing loss to one hoping it didn‚Äôt lose its starting quarterback. Chicago (5-5) dropped its fourth straight game on Monday night, falling to the division rival Vikings (4-5), 19-13. A potentially serious injury to Nick FolesÔªø, who was carted off in the game‚Äôs closing moments, made this latest defeat an even tougher pill to swallow as the club heads into its much-needed bye week.Dolphins waive veteran RB Jordan Howard - The Phinsider
After all, the Dolphins saw Myles Gaskin breakout early in the season, and his Huskies‚Äô teammate Salvin Ahmed has stepped up in his absence. Eric Studesville and the Dolphins front office have to be happy with the production they continue to get from their RB room. A room in which should get stronger in the near future with the return of veteran RB Matt Breida. We can also expect to see an increase in reps from De‚ÄôAndre Washington moving forward. Miami might not have a splashy name in their backfield, but they‚Äôre playing complimentary football.

241,eagles,https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2020/11/15/21566567/lets-break-down-what-is-actually-wrong-with-this-eagles-team-but-also#comments,,"Bleeding Green Nation, a Philadelphia Eagles communityBy mbizzle on Nov 15, 2020, 6:51pm EST +This loss was especially painful. Not because the Eagles played their same style of tiring, slow, messy, uninspired football like they do every week. But because it was a loss to a putrid Giants team that I have consistently said is quarterbacked by a QB who has no business being in the NFL, and a win today would've given us a nice cushion in our pathetic division before we embark on the toughest 4 game stretch, which we will almost certainly lose every one of those games.The Eagles offense and defense were both abysmal. But why is it that every week they are putting essentially the same product on the field? Why is it that we rarely see a receiver catching the ball in stride and running for 10+ yards after the catch? Why do most of our scoring drives take at least 9 plays? I don't have the magic answer but I am noticing trends that happen every game and it needs to be cleaned up IMMEDIATELY.The most minor issue (but still important) is that our punt return team is nonexistent. Why are our returners, whether it's Ward, Reagor, Desean, etc, ALWAYS calling for a fair catch, or even worse (as we saw several times today), letting the ball land on the 15 yard line and allowing it to roll further towards the end zone? Today's field position was absolutely brutal. We have not had a punt return of more than like 8 yards, all season long.Secondly, the defense is bad and Jim Schwartz does need to get fired. I don't want to throw that term out loosely. I don't want someone to lose their job. But it's time for Schwartz to go. We are constantly told we have a ""bend but not break defense."" What does that even mean? To me, it just sounds like we have a defense that allows constant big plays and that we allow any team to move the ball up and down the field, but occasionally we can make a redzone stop in a pivotal situation. I'm tired of that. Remember the Jim Johnson days when we had an actual legitimate defense? We need that. Our current squad can never make a big stop when given the opportunity. In today's game, after trailing 14-3, Boston Scott made a terrific run, and we went for 2 (a good call, in my opinion), and made it 14-11. Momentum seemed like it may start to shift. But then we all know what happened... the Giants go right down the field on their next drive in 5 plays, essentially negating any positivity that Scott's TD had. Far too often (Rams game, Ravens game, Steelers game, today's game), our offense looks like it may start digging itself out of a hole, but the defense then immediately lets up another TD drive.This is becoming a consistent pattern. And we still bite on that stupid QB rollout every game against every QB. This is not hard to defend against. Yet we are fooled every time.Doug's play calling is mind-boggling. Why in the world would you go for 2 to try and make it a two-point game, rather than kick a PAT and make it a three-point game in the second half? Why in the world are you going for it on 4th and 10 midway through the 4th quarter at midfield and only down by a TD, instead of punting and pinning the Giants back? To me, this decision by Pederson was his worst of the year. Obviously we didn't convert on the 4th and 10, and we give the Giants the ball at midfield and they of course kick a FG to put the game out of reach.Why did we draft Jalen Hurts in the second round? Honestly, I have no idea if he is good or not. he seems like he can be a great spark, and maybe even our next QB. But the way we use him is beyond stupid. Let him throw the ball! No one is falling for those delayed handoffs. Every team knows that when Hurts is in, it's a running play. And why do we use him so sparingly when this offense is in constant need of a jolt? Pederson's scheming with Hurts is so uncreative that even my girlfriend today, who knows absolutely nothing about anything football related, asked me ""why did they change quarterbacks just to do that play?"". I had no response. It was a great question from such a simple mind.Wentz is also missing throws that absolutely kills drives. The two throws that really stood out to me today that absolutely sucked was (the only?) throw to Alshon in the first quarter. Alshon was wide open about 25 yards down the field with room to run. And Wentz just missed him. Then later in the second half, on 3rd and 10, Wentz missed a somewhat WIDE OPEN Goedart in stride. This legitimately could've been a TD had Wentz put the ball where it needs to be. And as good as Miles Sanders is, he had two inexcusable drops on first down where he had no defenders around him. Wentz needs to start making these throws that literally every other QB in the league can make. And our guys need to stop dropping balls if they aren't placed perfectly in their hands. When was the last time one of our players made a catch where you thought to yourself, ""woah! nice catch! I totally understand why you're a professional athlete."" Our players literally can only catch balls that my friends and I make routinely in flag football. Someone needs to make a play and catch the ball even if it isn't 100% on target. (as an aside, It also is extremely painful that Arcega-Whiteside is basically no longer part of this team. We drafted Whiteside when Metcalf was still available. Just, wow. Think about that).Our secondary is basically incapable of intercepting passes. One play towards the end of the first half hit our cornerback right in his f ucking face. This happens every week. Our corners let interceptions slip right through their slippery fingers. Winning the turnover battle typically leads to winning the game. But we cannot generate a turnover for the life of us (except if its Brandon Graham strip sacking someone).Although not a trend, this honestly may have been Jason Kelce's worst game as an Eagle. My god he was awful today.So how do we fix this and potentially salvage this painful season? Well, the defense isn't going to magically get better overnight. And Schwartz is not getting fired midseason. This means our offense needs to step up. Doug needs to create a ""mini offense"" for Hurts, so that he can come in and run a few plays or drives consecutively. Remember when Kevin Kolb was absolutely abysmal against the Packers in 2010 and then Vick came in the second half and no one knew how to defend him? I'm not saying Hurts is the next Michael Vick. But he may be the fuel that starts a fire and can jolt this awful offense into something that can generate more than 20 points a game.Penalties are also killing us every week. Especially on kick returns and punt returns. So many pointless ""block behind the back"" penalties that pin us up against our own endzone. THIS FALLS ON COACHING. I don't think Pederson is a bad coach. But I think it's becoming incredibly obvious that Frank Reich was a huge reason that this team was successful in 2017.Lastly, what was the point of drafting Reagor if we never throw the ball deep to him? Why are we throwing him those stupid WR screens that never seem to work, or just throwing the ball to him 6 yards down the sideline? I remember week 1 against the Redskins, Reagor converted a 3rd and 23 for 56 yards. Several drives later, Wentz missed him wide open on what would've been an 80 yard TD. The dude clearly has speed and reliable hands. So If we drafted Reagor for his speed, then why are we not using it???And finally, stop deferring the ball if we win the coin toss. I know lots of teams do this. But we are so bad and we are constantly falling behind early in games. I think it's important we (FOR ONCE) try to take the lead in the beginning of a game. Every game we are playing from behind. We need to score first for once."

Let‚Äôs take a look at how all 32 teams stack up. Don‚Äôt forget to hear me talking about the league‚Äôs landscape on my national podcast: The ODDcast!1 - Pittsburgh Steelers (Last Week: 1) - With a blowout victory over a division rival to reach 9-0, the Steelers clinched a winning record for the sixth time in seven seasons. Pittsburgh is eyeing their seventh Vince Lombardi Trophy.2 - Kansas City Chiefs (LW: 2) - The Chiefs return from their bye to face a Las Vegas team that beat them earlier this season.3 - New Orleans Saints (LW: 3) - On the bright side, they‚Äôre 7-2 after six straight wins. On the dark side, Drew Brees will miss ‚Äúsome time‚Äù after suffering broken ribs and a lung collapse. It‚Äôll be interesting to see what Jameis Winston can do until Brees returns. Winnable games up next: vs. ATL, at DEN, vs. ATL.4 - Green Bay Packers (LW: 6) - The Packers only won by four points despite being 14-point favorites. They‚Äôre 7-2 and pretty good ‚Ä¶ but not flat out elite. Only eighth in DVOA and ninth in point differential.5 - Miami Dolphins (LW: 10) - The Dolphins are awesome. They‚Äôve won five in a row and they rank fifth in point differential. The quarterback switch from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Tua Tagovailoa has clearly worked out so far; the rookie is playing well. Legitimate threat to win the AFC East! They also currently have a top six pick in the 2021 NFL Draft thanks to Houston being bad.6 - Tampa Bay Buccaneers (LW: 9) - Tom Brady has a history of bouncing back from really bad losses. That‚Äôs exactly what he did against Carolina.7 - Arizona Cardinals (LW: 11) - I‚Äôm beginning to think the Cardinals may have won the DeAndre Hopkins trade. This big win has Arizona in the NFC West lead.This is why you trade for DeAndre Hopkins

(and why you don't trade him away ) pic.twitter.com/cesPQe27PO8 - Buffalo Bills (LW: 8) - Pretty tough to lose on a Hail Mary like that. That defeat probably ended their shot at a top two seed in the AFC playoff picture. And their spot atop their division is less secure with Miami on the rise.9 - Baltimore Ravens (LW: 4) - The offense continues to not look right. The Ravens are 4-3 in their last seven games and Lamar Jackson has a 85.9 passer rating in that span. Losing to the Pats likely ended any hope of winning the AFC North.10 - Los Angeles Rams (LW: 12) - The Rams‚Äô defense is very good. They‚Äôve allowed just 16.4 offensive points per game, fewest in the NFL. Los Angeles will at least be a wild card team and they‚Äôre in the mix for the NFC West crown.11 - Seattle Seahawks (LW: 5) - The Seahawks are 1-3 in their last four games. Russell Wilson has 10 turnovers in that span. The guy who looked like the NFL‚Äôs MVP earlier in the season has to be better than that.12 - Las Vegas Raiders (LW: 13) - Jon Gruden has led the Raiders to three straight wins. Can they now beat KC twice in one season? Big test ahead.13 - Indianapolis Colts (LW: 14) - Big win for the Colts on Thursday Night Football to take the lead in the AFC South. That defense is really solid and Philip Rivers is playing his best ball recently. He‚Äôs got a nice weapon in Nyheim Hines.14 - Tennessee Titans (LW: 7) - The Titans are 1-3 in their last four games. Stephen Gostkowski‚Äôs eight field goal misses and two extra point misses have contributed to a team that ranks 30th in special teams DVOA.15 - Cleveland Browns (LW: 15) - Things haven‚Äôt been pretty for the Browns lately but they‚Äôre in the hunt for a playoff spot at 6-3. Though I‚Äôm not sure they‚Äôll ever win another game after this:.@bakermayfield on @MylesLGarrett: ""Real Gs move in silence like lasagna."" pic.twitter.com/qXiipOOv4v16 - Minnesota Vikings (LW: 16) - Don‚Äôt look now but the Vikings have won three in a row and they‚Äôre not dead in the NFC playoff picture. Kirk Cousins FINALLY got a win on Monday Night Football, bringing him up to 1-9 in his career. Naturally, it was achieved with no fans in the stands. Justin Jefferson is now up to four 100+ yards out of nine in his career. He‚Äôs kinda good.17 - New England Patriots (LW: 23) - Very good win over Baltimore after barely beating NYJ last week. They have ground to make up but the Pats‚Äô season isn‚Äôt necessarily over yet.18 - Carolina Panthers (LW: 17) - The Panthers have lost five in a row but this has been an overall encouraging season for them. Shame that Teddy Bridgewater got hurt but not the worst thing in the world for the Panthers to potentially get a look at XFL superstar P.J. Walker.19 - Cincinnati Bengals (LW: 18) - Joe Burrow will lead the Bengals to victory over Pittsburgh some day in the future ‚Ä¶ but not now. A team that finished with the No. 1 overall pick last year still needs to be infused with more talent.20 - Chicago Bears (LW: 19) - Let‚Äôs all hope Nick Foles isn‚Äôt seriously hurt and can get back soon. But he might not be playing even if healthy considering the Bears are now 2-5 with him as their starter. We could soon see Foles replaced by Mitchell Trubisky.21 - Detroit Lions (LW: 24) - Does Matt Patricia get fired if the Lions don‚Äôt end up recovering from a big blown lead? He continues to narrowly avoid his inevitable termination.22 - Los Angeles Chargers (LW: 21) - The Bolts need a new coaching staff. Should be a pretty attractive job with Justin Herbert in place.23 - New York Giants (LW: 27) - The Giants beating Philly for the first time since 2016 qualifies as a signature win for Joe Judge. The rookie head coach might actually be able to lead the G-Men to winning the NFC East.24 - San Francisco 49ers (LW: 20) - I think it‚Äôs safe to say the 49ers aren‚Äôt going very far with Nick Mullens under center.25 - Atlanta Falcons (LW: 25) - The Falcons return from their bye to play on the road in New Orleans. They‚Äôll be 3-7 if they can‚Äôt pull off the upset.26 - Philadelphia Eagles (LW: 22) - The Eagles have serious issues when it comes to their quarterback, coaching staff, and front office. Their foundation is hardly as solid as it was once thought to be.27 - Denver Broncos (LW: 26) - Drew Lock has thrown seven touchdowns to 10 interceptions this season. Maybe he can further develop into an OK backup but the Broncos need to find a legitimate long-term starter.28 - Houston Texans (LW: 28) - Deshaun Watson has a 107.0 passer rating this season. That the Texans are only 2-7 speaks to how flawed everything is around him.29 - Washington Football Team (LW: 29) - Alex Smith almost led the Football Team to a big comeback win after being down by 21 points halfway through the third quarter. Despite their loss, Washington still has hope to win the NFC East. Which is crazy because they‚Äôd be picking third overall if the season ended today.30 - Dallas Cowboys (LW: 30) - The Cowboys return from their bye to travel to Minnesota. Dallas could be looking at dropping to 2-8.31 - Jacksonville Jaguars (LW: 31) - The Jags gave good effort in a close loss to Green Bay. Perfect tanking result. Currently on track for the No. 2 pick.32 - New York Jets (LW: 32) - The Jets return from their bye to face LAC on the road. Must-lose game to maintain their chances of landing the No. 1 overall pick."

292,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/16/21569450/chiefs-playoff-picture-beat-the-raiders-edition-week-11,Chiefs playoff picture: Beat the Raiders edition,"FILED UNDER:Let‚Äôs take a look at where the Chiefs stand after their bye week.The Kansas City Chiefs have come out of their Week 10 bye with a 8-1 record. Seven weeks remain in the NFL season, in which the Chiefs will face the Las Vegas Raiders (6-3) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-3) on the road, the Denver Broncos (3-6) at home, the Miami Dolphins (6-3) and New Orleans Saints (7-2) on the road and the Atlanta Falcons (3-6) and Los Angeles Chargers (2-7) at home.Let‚Äôs take a look at the team‚Äôs current playoff picture. Just as we did last season, we‚Äôll use the New York Times playoff calculator to help us figure out what‚Äôs on the horizon.As it stands right now, the Chiefs have a 99% chance to make the playoffs, an 87% chance to win their fifth-straight AFC West championship, a 34% chance to win the single AFC bye and a 16% chance to win Super Bowl LV. No other team currently has a better chance to win the championship ‚Äî although the Pittsburgh Steelers (14%) and New Orleans Saints (13%) are right behind the Chiefs.These percentages begin with the Sagarin ratings for each NFL team. This system determines the relative strength of every team, which are then used to figure the probability teams will win each of their remaining games. Using this data, the remainder of the season is simulated tens of thousands of times ‚Äî and the results of these projections give us our answers. So ‚Äî for example ‚Äî in 99% of the simulations, the Chiefs make the playoffs.The playoff calculator also allows us to assume the outcome of any remaining game and then see how it changes things.Any combination four wins on the Chiefs‚Äô remaining schedule will clinch a playoff berth. In fact, most combinations of any three wins will lock up a spot in the postseason. But I could not find a single three-win combination where the team‚Äôs chance to make the playoffs fell below 99% ‚Äî and in most cases, it was better than 99%.Here‚Äôs an example: suppose the Chiefs lose their most-difficult remaining games ‚Äî against the Raiders, Buccaneers, Dolphins and Saints ‚Äî and defeat the Broncos, Falcons and Chargers. Their chance to make the playoffs would be greater than 99%. But if the Minnesota Vikings beat the Chicago Bears in Week 10‚Äôs final game on Monday night, this three-win scenario would clinch a postseason berth for the Chiefs. So would a Baltimore Ravens loss to the Tennessee Titans ‚Äî or a New York Jets victory over the Broncos ‚Äî in Week 11... and so on.Short answer: if the Chiefs go at least 4-3, they‚Äôre in. If they go 3-4, they‚Äôre almost certainly in.With the Raiders at 6-3 (and holding a win against the Chiefs), it‚Äôs obviously essential for the Chiefs to win in Las Vegas this Sunday night in order to win the division. By itself, a win boosts the Chiefs‚Äô chance to 96%, while a loss drops it to 74%. Beating the Raiders (and winning their other remaining division games) pushes their chance to win the West above 99%. Add in another Chiefs victory ‚Äî or any Raiders loss (except to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 14) ‚Äî and the Chiefs will finish on top.This is the time of year where we would normally say that a team with an 8-1 record controls its own destiny to land a postseason bye ‚Äî that is, if they win the rest of their games, they‚Äôll be assured of a week off to begin the postseason. But since the NFL‚Äôs expanded playoff format now allows only one team to get a bye ‚Äî and the Steelers now stand 9-0 after defeating the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday ‚Äî it‚Äôs not that simple.Should the Chiefs take care of business ‚Äî finishing the season 7-0 ‚Äî they‚Äôll have a 91% chance to land the #1 seed. Given that 7-0 finish, Steelers losses to the Ravens in Week 12 (or the Buffalo Bills in Week 14) would clinch a Chiefs bye. Of course, other Steelers losses would improve the Chiefs‚Äô chance to claim the top spot ‚Äî but by themselves, only losses to the Ravens or Bills (combined with a Chiefs 7-0 finish) would clinch it.But that also means any Chiefs loss would make getting a bye significantly more difficult. In terms of the bye, the best-case Kansas City loss would be to the Falcons in Week 16. With that 6-1 record to finish the season, the Chiefs would need that Week 14 Bills win (or the Week 12 Ravens win and at least one more Steelers loss) to clinch the bye.All of these scenarios start at one place: defeating the Raiders in Las Vegas this Sunday night. Before the season began, it‚Äôs unlikely likely most Chiefs fans would have considered this contest to be one of the season‚Äôs key games.But... here we are. Welcome to Raider Week."
293,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/16/21570650/andy-reid-roundup-four-takeaways-from-the-chiefs-head-coach#comments,Andy Reid roundup: four takeaways from the Chiefs head coach,"FILED UNDER:Reid joined the media as the Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô bye week ended and the team began preparation for the Las Vegas Raiders.Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid met with the media over Zoom conference call Monday, as the team got back to work following its Week 10 bye.Watch the full presser above or by clicking here. Here were the most significant takeaways:Chiefs defensive end Taco Charlton tweeted that he indeed fractured his ankle in the last game.‚ÄúI‚Äôll get that to you when we put out whatever we‚Äôre going to put out there,‚Äù Reid said of Charlton‚Äôs status. ‚ÄúHe did hurt it and he did fracture it, so we‚Äôll see what we do from that point.‚ÄùReid then confirmed the Chiefs would continue to take a wait-and-see approach with cornerback L‚ÄôJarius Sneed. Sneed returned to the practice field last Wednesday.Wide receiver Mecole Hardman is still on the reserve/COVID-19 list.‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I can get into or can‚Äôt get into on that, but he is on the list,‚Äù he said of Hardman. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got to wait here on his days and right now he‚Äôs feeling good which is a good thing. He‚Äôs on that list and I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I can tell you other than he‚Äôs on the list and he‚Äôs feeling good right now.‚ÄùAllegretti has started at left guard the last three games for the Chiefs.‚ÄúHe‚Äôs done a nice job,‚Äù said Reid. ‚ÄúI would tell you it‚Äôs been great for him; it‚Äôs been great for our football team right now. He does it with a lot of energy which we appreciate. He‚Äôs got a great attitude about him, he brings great energy to that group, he‚Äôs always hustling, he‚Äôs got that wrestler mentality that is his background.‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just see. We‚Äôll see how things go down the road. As you know, you can‚Äôt have enough good ones. He‚Äôs proved that he can get in there and play.‚ÄùBeing the reigning Super Bowl champions requires fighting complacency in order to have the best chance of repeating. The Chiefs have won eight of nine games, but Reid will look for his team to continue that energy following the bye week.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important when the guys get back in here, that they get back in here with the same purpose ‚Äî and coaches likewise,‚Äù he said. ‚Äúthat you don‚Äôt pull off on the work and so if there‚Äôs one thing that the guys have done is the guys have maintained that, not only players but coaches and that ends up I think being important. Nobody‚Äôs pointing fingers, not everything goes right offensively, defensively or special teams but guys just jump and say, ‚ÄòListen, let‚Äôs try to figure this out,‚Äô and if one sides down, let‚Äôs get the other side ‚Äì you pick it up and let‚Äôs go.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how they‚Äôve been, and it is a bit like last year in that way, at least the latter half of the year. At the same time, you have to stay on top of that part and keep that same attitude and I have no question the guys will do that, but you have to do that.‚ÄùThe question regarding new play designs came after it was revealed that quarterback Patrick Mahomes designed the idea for Ferrari Right.‚ÄúSo far, that‚Äôs one,‚Äù Reid said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs had ideas, we‚Äôve used other players ideas and I‚Äôm free game. If you got a good one, let‚Äôs go. If you got one, bring it on, we‚Äôll take it. I‚Äôm easy that way. If they look good, we‚Äôll try it on and see how it work, but I think it‚Äôs healthy.‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs healthy for guys. They‚Äôre thinking football which is important, and you hope that your guys are in the frame of mind to do that.‚ÄùSend your play drawings to 1 Arrowhead Drive."

295,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/17/21570890/midseason-check-in-five-chiefs-in-a-contract-year,,"FILED UNDER:Five players have the rest of the campaign to prove their worthiness of a deal this offseason.With seven games remaining on the Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô 2020 regular-season schedule, certain players will feel the pressure to solidify their role and establish themselves as a part of the future due to their contract situation.From expiring rookie contracts to veteran role players hoping to re-sign, there are significant decisions the team will need to make in the offseason. The projection of a reduced salary cap in 2021 could make these decisions even more important than they already were.I highlighted most of these players in an offseason article about contract years, but I took a closer look at the performance so far of five Chiefs playing on expiring contracts this season:When I awarded defensive tackle Chris Jones with the midseason defensive MVP award, I noticed one name pop up constantly in the comment section and replies to social media posts from the readers. Safety Dan Sorensen ‚Äî who received one vote from staff writer Tom Childs ‚Äî has stood out enough to warrant that kind of praise from fans. That‚Äôs important for him, as that means the 30-year-old is standing out in a contract season.Sorensen has the fourth-most defensive snaps on the team. That tells you how often they are in nickel ‚Äî where safety Tyrann Mathieu becomes the slot cornerback and Sorensen comes in at strong safety, paired with free safety Juan Thornhill. Sorensen is trusted to be the deep safety at times, but 46% of his snaps come inside the box for a reason.Sorensen is uniquely explosive and coordinated enough to turn that into effective open-field tackling. In the 2014 NFL Draft process, Sorensen ran a 6.47 second 3-cone drill ‚Äî putting him in the 98th percentile of safeties at the combine all-time. You‚Äôve especially seen it this year in his play against the run, which has led to him being the team‚Äôs leading tackler.His faults come mainly in pass coverage, and he will get targeted by the opposing passing games. That ability doesn‚Äôt start improving going into an eighth NFL season, and the skill of pass coverage is as important as ever with modern offenses. That being said, Sorensen is a team leader and a staple of one of the league‚Äôs top defenses right now.If the coaching staff insists that he‚Äôs significant enough, he may become a priority to re-sign.After restructuring his contract for 2020, wide receiver Sammy Watkins had a lot of reason to put up big numbers this year. The new part of the deal was incentives for statistical season totals, up to $7 million in addition to his $5 million base salary.Through four games, Watkins was on pace for 76 catches, 792 receiving yards and four touchdowns. Those totals would not hit his incentive requirement, for what it‚Äôs worth. He did manage to score his second touchdown of the season in Week 5 before limping off the field with a hamstring injury. He was never placed on injured reserve but has not been active for a game since.The offense hasn‚Äôt experienced any noticeable drop-off in performance with Watkins out of the lineup. They also haven‚Äôt played any challenging defenses in that stretch. In the final seven games of the regular season, they will need all hands on deck offensively, so it will be significant to see when he returns after the bye week.If he comes back and plays like he did in the final games of the 2019 championship run, there‚Äôs every reason in the world to make another short-term, incentivized deal work.In the first contract year of his NFL career, defensive end Tanoh Kpassagnon has not put up a big number in the one statistic that garners the big pay day: sacks. Kpassagnon has only managed one sack so far this season. That being said, he has been a dependable starter opposite defensive end Frank Clark.Kpassagnon has played the third-most snaps of any defensive player on the Chiefs this year; he‚Äôs played the most out of the defensive linemen on the team. In fact, he‚Äôs been on the field for 81% of the defense‚Äôs snaps ‚Äî the ninth-highest percentage among NFL defensive linemen this year, per Football Outsiders.He‚Äôs made some plays, but he doesn‚Äôt make enough with his snap volume. Kpassagnon has the third-most pressures on the team despite out-snapping Clark and defensive tackle Chris Jones ahead of him. He has used his incredible length to bat down two passes this season, but he does not consistently win against pass blocking.He has been stout against the run; his 15 run stops are tired for most among Chiefs‚Äô defensive linemen.Behind Jones‚Äô dominance this season, no other pass rusher has stepped up on a regular basis. If Kpassagnon can prove to be a quality pass rusher every game and not just in spurts, he‚Äôd be a quality candidate to re-sign. He‚Äôs proven his reliability ‚Äî but in today‚Äôs game, starting defensive linemen need to affect the quarterback‚Äôs passing efforts.After starting all 19 games in the 2019 season for the Super Bowl champion Chiefs, center Austin Reiter has lost his grip on the starting spot. He started the first five games of the season, but the team decided to start veteran center Daniel Kilgore for Week 6 against the Buffalo Bills. Kilgore started the following two weeks as well.Head coach Andy Reid cited knee soreness as a reason for Reiter‚Äôs absence from the lineup, but he was active for the three games he was benched and played special teams as well. He did return to the starting lineup for the Week 9 win over the Carolina Panthers. It will be significant to see who comes out after they bye week as the starter between him and Kilgore.The swapping is an indicator that the Chiefs are not satisfied with their situation at center. It‚Äôs hard to imagine either of Reiter or Kilgore being on the team in 2021, but if one of them does anchor down the job for another deep postseason run, it could turn into a cheap solution for a starter.The Chiefs‚Äô linebacker group gets some deserved flack for being soft at times, but it‚Äôs hard to say that about linebacker Damien Wilson. The starting SAM linebacker, who will also play off-ball in the base nickel package, shows flashes of great strength and power in the run game. He‚Äôs produced to back that up.Wilson is the team‚Äôs second-leading tackler, and is tied for first in run stops with Sorensen. He‚Äôs also one of only three players with one or fewer missed tackles despite playing 300 or more snaps.Wilson just isn‚Äôt very fast sideline-to-sideline ‚Äî and he‚Äôs asked to do that when he is played as an off-ball linebacker. Opposing offenses game plan to take advantage of those faults every week. Rookie linebacker Willie Gay Jr. projects to eventually replace Wilson‚Äôs position as an off-ball player; Wilson could still be the SAM position ‚Äî but with how little true base defense is played in today‚Äôs NFL, the Chiefs may not feel like it‚Äôs worth giving a new contract to a player that‚Äôs strictly a SAM linebacker.The 27-year-old linebacker could price himself out in the open market, regardless; the shine from being on a championship team can be valuable for a free agent."

The ball is signed by Mahomes and 21 other players with ‚Äú2013 Whitehouse Wildcats‚Äù written on it.

Mahomes signed and wrote his No. 5 at the top right.The baseball came into play days later. The child threw out the first pitch to Mahomes at the Class 4A Region II championship game, which the Wildcats won.

Bolles hasn‚Äôt missed a snap this year and is down to three total penalties, which is a fantastic reduction from his 2018 and 2019 seasons, in which he logged 10 apiece. He has not allowed a sack in 2020.Obviously, this is not an award that anyone wants to take away from Alex Smith, unless you‚Äôre Gary Gramling, who voted for Jason Verrett. Gary also hates Rudy and rooted for the CCCP in Miracle. However, I think Bolles is developing and deserves some shine.Three of four men recant robbery statements against CB DeAndre Baker | ESPNJulius Lamar, Steven Compton and Tommy J. Hartshaw said in sworn statements that Baker ‚Äúdid not directly or indirectly participate in any robbery or assist in a robbery at the scene or elsewhere.‚Äù The three men added that they didn‚Äôt see Baker rob or assault anyone with or without a firearm.Baker is being prosecuted in Florida on four counts of robbery with a firearm. He was originally charged with four counts of armed robbery and four counts of aggravated assault with a firearm after attending a party in Miramar, Florida, in May.The Giants released Baker this summer after telling him to stay away from the team during its virtual offseason as he attended to his legal problems. The league then put him on the commissioner‚Äôs exempt list. He is currently a free agent.If convicted, Baker faces a mandatory minimum of 10 years and up to life in state prison.Arrowhead Pride Midseason Awards: Team MVP, offensive and defensive players of the yearDefensive Player of the YearDefensive tackle Chris JonesOthers receiving votes: Safety Tyrann Mathieu, defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi, safety Daniel SorensenJones received five votes for his play so far. Mathieu received two votes for his efforts, while Nnadi and Sorensen each earned one.While the defense has had its ups and downs this season, Jones has consistently been disruptive to opposing offenses. His pass-rushing dominance continues to be as fun to watch as it is significant to the unit‚Äôs success. He leads the entire unit in quarterback pressures, sacks and forced fumbles ‚Äî and has missed only one game this season. Among all NFL defenders, he has the ninth-most pressures and the third-most quarterback hits.His performance has been noticeable because he often seems to be the only defensive lineman who can create true quarterback pressure throughout a game. He leads all of his teammates by ten pressures ‚Äî and most of them have played in one more game than he has.Jones‚Äô teammates will need to step up to achieve the pass rush unit‚Äôs full potential. With the way he‚Äôs playing, an uptick of performance from defensive end Frank Clark (and other linemen) could quickly turn the Chiefs‚Äô front four into the league‚Äôs most-feared pass rushers."

Not only that, he‚Äôs accomplished this feat with a redshirt year in his rookie season, fewer than 20 career interceptions and a win percentage of 0.800.The reigning Super Bowl MVP enters the bye week fresh off a 372-yard, four-touchdown performance against the Carolina Panthers. The game put him firmly in this season‚Äôs MVP conversation ‚Äî and he deserves it. Mahomes would have to average more than one interception per game for the rest of the season to break double digits; he‚Äôs turned the ball over exactly once this year.As the season heats up, Mahomes is starting to hit his stride, notching nine touchdown passes over the last two games. There are some big challenges looming ‚Äî and Mahomes will surely be slinging it. These marquee games will solidify his positioning for postseason honors. If he continues to play like he has been, his acceptance speech for his second MVP will be have to be recorded in advance ‚Äî because he‚Äôll be getting ready for his second Super Bowl.Let‚Äôs take a closer look at Mamhomes‚Äô performance against the Panthers on Sunday.Chiefs fans are blessed to have a play-caller willing to try things like Ferrari Right.Rose Bowl. Hungry Pig. Now Ferrari. What a gift Andy Reid is.

The design screwed up the linebackers terribly. Demarcus Robinson is wide open with no underneath defenders in sight.

I bet there's some kind of direct snap to the RB off of this too. pic.twitter.com/2rAXOUlbLkMotioning the quarterback into the snap? Whaaaat?You might wonder how this could be legal ‚Äî but it‚Äôs absolutely within the rules. Just as with any other offensive position, as long as the quarterback isn‚Äôt motioning forward at the snap, the motion is completely legal.The beauty of the quarterback motion is that it looks like a sprint-out to the boundary ‚Äî which the Panthers had seen the Chiefs do on film. You can see the defenders flow to the play as if it‚Äôs a sprint-out; the linebackers are in full pursuit. What‚Äôs more, the fact that Mahomes is moving makes it easier for him to flip back and the roll out in the opposite direction. The design leads to a wide-open touchdown to Demarcus Robinson ‚Äî who slips to the backline off the fake sprint-action towards him.I don‚Äôt think this is the last time we‚Äôll see Ferrari. There is likely a series of plays the Chiefs can run out of this look in the red zone. They could actually do a sprint-out to the boundary and then slip a little middle screen to Travis Kelce. Or motion with Mahomes, but then direct snap to the running back. Or toss a throwback screen to the running back after Mahomes rolls out. Linebackers‚Äô heads would be spinning.Bad miss on the end of half drive. Mahomes couldn't overcome closed hips to the flat here. It's tough to throw all the way to your left if your hips aren't open to it. pic.twitter.com/YWntSUoEPUIt ultimately didn‚Äôt matter because an offensive pass interference penalty, but if Mahomes hadn‚Äôt sailed the ball over running back Darrel Williams‚Äô head, this could have been a play that put the Chiefs in field goal range.Sometimes there are some inconsistencies with some of these plays in the flat. But in this instance, Mahomes tried to throw wide to his left with a closed hip. The problem is that when you can‚Äôt entirely open your hips to the target, more variables come to play; your upper body has to account for the lack of a good base, making it more of an adventure to complete the pass.Here, Mahomes is locked up because he was late to get to the back ‚Äî something that is not all that uncommon for him. It‚Äôs not entirely a bad thing. Sometimes it can give him time to give downfield plays more of a chance or be late to a checkdown ‚Äî but here, it means that he‚Äôs not in the best position to make a throw to his left.Quarterbacks who are highly prepared can process the game quickly and throw with anticipation. I say this once a year: when a quarterback is throwing with anticipation, it‚Äôs because of the work they put in during the week. Understanding your own concepts (and the coverages you might see) allows you to process the game quickly enough to have confidence about where you can throw.This is insane anticipation by Mahomes on this throw. Hardman has barely broken to the MOF and Mahomes just throws a ball behind the linebacker like it's an 18 yard dig. Wild arm talent. pic.twitter.com/7U4C9GD7BlOn this play, we can clearly see Mahomes did his work during the week. He‚Äôs quickly keys on the Tampa 2 coverage, allowing him to be ready ahead of time to throw the ball to a space where he knows no one will be.This is what it looks like when Mahomes is throwing the ball. pic.twitter.com/32jXytn2qTOn this play, Mahomes hits Mecole Hardman on a corner post ‚Äî and when the ball is thrown, the second-year receiver has barely broken for the middle of the field. Carolina linebacker Shaq Thompson ‚Äî an athletic player ‚Äî is running the seam in Tampa coverage. Mahomes confidently tries to get the ball behind him. He‚Äôs successful, driving the ball like it‚Äôs an 18-yard route.Mahomes can fit a ball wherever he wants ‚Äî especially with this kind of anticipation.Mahomes has more ability to throw from an unstable base than anyone in the league.Mahomes has so many arm angles from a variety of platforms that he can deliver a ball with accuracy consistently. Pressure closing, he accounts for his base with arm angle and is able to still lead Kelce for a nice gain as he's getting hit. pic.twitter.com/fH0GYDklVkEarlier, I pointed out a flaw in a route to the flat ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean Mahomes can‚Äôt still throw from a variety of platforms. No one has more ways to deliver a ball than he does ‚Äî which makes the occasional lapses in the flat (particularly to his left) surprising.On this play, Mahomes is able to easily account for his unstable base. Where earlier there were issues with his closed hip, this is accounting for the inverse. Mahomes‚Äô hips are more open than he‚Äôd like when throwing to his right ‚Äî but with a defensive lineman closing, he‚Äôs running out of time. He can‚Äôt set his feet more towards his target, so he adjusts his arm angle to more easily lead Kelce on the throw. This allows him to beat the pressure, throwing an accurate ball to a tight window.If you‚Äôve been worried about some of the Mahomes‚Äô previous issues with pocket management, this clip will give you some confidence in the future.Mahomes stepping up in the pocket with frontside pressure and finding Kelce on a Y-Wrap for a big gain on 3rd and 7. pic.twitter.com/uTZEM8qja2In some weeks, we‚Äôve seen Mahomes fading, dropping too deep or unnecessarily bouncing out of the pocket. But on this play, he steps up against front-side pressure and keeps his eyes up. Then while on the run, he delivers a great throw (with touch) to Kelce, who is beating a poor defender on a Y-Wrap.Moving forward, this is a positive indicator. Mahomes isn‚Äôt always perfect in the pocket ‚Äî but seeing good reps like this one is important for the remainder of the season. They represent growth."

The news came shortly after Yates‚Äô ESPN colleague, Adam Schefter, reported that the Chiefs asked the NFL to launch a COVID protocol-related inquiry with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA).2/2 Concern is this is a violation of NFL-NFLPA protocols and the rep is not subject to same testing as players and personnel and regularly travels among clubs, per source. NFL and team believes this created unnecessary risk of exposure to players and staff. https://t.co/XG8b60qFUbSchefter later added that the NFLPA had been made aware of the situation and took action. It is unclear as of this writing if the two matters are related.The Chiefs are currently in the midst of their Week 10 bye week, with their next game scheduled for Sunday, November 22, against the Las Vegas Raiders.Chiefs head coach Andy Reid told media members Monday that he encouraged the players to stay away from the practice facility to rest, though they would be going through coronavirus testing daily at an on-site trailer.In nine games this season, Hardman has 25 catches for 395 yards and three touchdowns."
307,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/14/21565740/turnover-worthy-plays#comments,,"Arrowhead Pride | Kansas City Chiefs Schedule, News, Roster and StatsBy CoachJA Ôòë @CoachJimAdam on Nov 14, 2020, 11:06pm CST +It's annoying how many football scribes trot out PFF's ""Turnover Worthy Play"" stat when trying to make a horse race out of the MVP derby. Mahomes supposedly has 9 of those - basically one for every game so far this season.I'm willing to accept PFF's TWP's as potentially useful IF they will publish an answer to the following:I'm not a PFF subscriber, but I'm guessing that with some reasonable minimum of throws, there's never been a 9.0 for a season. And if he did end up setting the all-time mark for that ratio, I'd really like to ask PFF one more question... Is there a chance that the TWP is a judgement call that the PFF judges are incapable of making with accuracy? Or perhaps, that PFF judges are fudging against MVPatrick?In the one article I could find about it, TWP's in 2017 that were graded -1.0 were intercepted more than 1/3rd of the time. Throws graded -1.5 were picked 58.3% of the time and -2.0 throws were intercepted more than 83% of the time. Assuming ALL of Mahomes' TWPs were 1, he should have at this point AT MOST just 3 or 4 Turnover Worthy Plays, not 9. But surely some of his throws - especially the one Int - were probably graded -1.5 or -2.0. So he should actually have FAR fewer TWP's than he does right now to stay within what I suspect are statistical norms.Sure, sure... small sample size... that's what they always say.I have an alternative explanation for Mahomes' suspiciously high number of TWP's. Mahomes' other numbers screw up all of PFF's scatter plots, diminish other QB's by comparison, and depress interest in PFF QB comparisons. Those would be pretty strong reasons for PFF to be a little TOO subjective in their grading scales.After all - who would be crazy enough to try to measure a TWP/INT ratio as a self-scout of their own grading system? In other words... who grades the graders?P.S. - Any of you that are subscribers can leap to PFF's defense if I've got this wrong. If they're right, then Patrick should have three or more picks by now and the Chiefs are just lucky to be 8-1. But it just doesn't look that way to my (no doubt biased) eyes.This is a FanPost and does not necessarily reflect the views of Arrowhead Pride's writers or editors. It does reflect the views of this particular fan though, which is as important as the views of Arrowhead Pride writers or editors."

Players with the biggest difference between their current ranking and their salary cap hit represent the best bang-for-the-buck on the Chiefs roster. Others have the exact same ranking in each category, indicating that they are performing exactly the level you‚Äôd hope for given their salary cap hit. But those whose cap hit ranking is far higher than their current performance might represent a red flag (or sell signal) if things don‚Äôt turn around after the bye.Here are some of the notable players in each category based on this week‚Äôs Market Movers database."
310,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/12/21559307/the-last-word-on-the-nfl-strength-of-schedule-for-the-rest-of-2020-chiefs,,"FILED UNDER:So how hard is the Chiefs‚Äô schedule going to be? Let‚Äôs find a definitive answer.Here‚Äôs the question all NFL fans ask somewhere around the middle of the season ‚Äî especially those whose teams have a chance of making the postseason: ‚ÄúHow difficult is the remaining schedule for my team?‚ÄùOr more specifically, ‚ÄúHow difficult is the remaining schedule for the Kansas City Chiefs?‚ÄùHere‚Äôs how things stand going into Week 10:As you can see, the Chiefs have the 19th-easiest strength of schedule to finish the season. That‚Äôs pretty... average.But I‚Äôd like to draw your attention to the final column of this table, which converts each team‚Äôs strength-of-schedule into standard deviations from average (sometimes this is called a Z-score) and displays it an easier-for-humans-to-grasp letter grade.This tells us that the Chiefs actually do have an average schedule ‚Äî but also that the teams ranked between 13th and 20th (also with C grades) all have strength-of-schedules that are not statistically different from each other. All of these C teams have measurably easier schedules than teams with C- grades ‚Äî and measurably harder than teams with C+ grades.But here‚Äôs an important point: the difference between these teams with measurably different C grades is not statistically significant.Here‚Äôs the rule of thumb: for two values measured in this way, a statistically-significant difference exists only when they are at least a full letter-grade apart ‚Äî for example, B to A or D+ to C+.Is simply averaging the won/lost records of a team‚Äôs upcoming opponents really the right way to do this? Bill Parcells famously said that ‚Äúyou are what your record says you are‚Äù ‚Äî and he had a point. But it‚Äôs also true that not all records are created equal; one team‚Äôs 6-2 record against a bunch of poor teams doesn‚Äôt say the same thing as a another team‚Äôs 6-2 record against a bunch of playoff contenders.There are several methods of rating the relative strength of football teams that take the quality of their previous opponents into account. Using the simplest of these ‚Äî the SRS system used by Pro-Football-Reference.com ‚Äî let‚Äôs see how that changes the NFL‚Äôs strength-of-schedule going into Week 10.Whoa! The Chiefs drop from 19th-easiest to 29th-easiest. Once we‚Äôve applied the simplest possible method to adjust for the quality of upcoming opponents, a number of teams move around. The Chiefs, Chicago Bears, New Orleans Saints and Tampa Bay Buccaneers all have harder schedules that we first thought, while the Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers all have easier ones.But again... let‚Äôs not get too excited. The letter grades tell a somewhat different story. Using SRS, the Chiefs fall just outside that average range with a D+. The Buccaneers ‚Äî falling from 10th to 25th ‚Äî come closest to dropping a full letter grade.So using a different dataset to compare relative strength-of-schedules does make a measurable difference ‚Äî although not necessarily a significant one.There are other ways to measure team strength based on the quality of their previous opponents. The other big ones are the ELO ratings used by FiveThirtyEight.com and DVOA published by FootballOutsiders.com. Along with SRS, these systems all use different methods. While they all have pros and cons, they arrive at fairly similar (but certainly not identical) results. Here‚Äôs a side-by side comparison at how each of these systems now assess the strength-of-schedule for every NFL team:The rank (and grade) for each system are shown in parentheses. As you can see, in most cases, they give fairly similar results ‚Äî especially when you compare letter grades. Finally, I averaged the Z-scores for all three results to create the aggregate letter grade for each team ‚Äî also displayed in parentheses.One thing is that the Chiefs may have a somewhat harder remaining schedule than you may have thought. During a recent Chiefs game broadcast, the network displayed a graphic that said the team had one of the league‚Äôs easiest schedules. While that might have been true in that moment, game results since then (including a lot of recent upsets) have changed things ‚Äî especially when you take the extra step of considering the real quality of upcoming opponents.The other thing is that while teams like the Denver Broncos, Jacksonville Jaguars and Atlanta Falcons should be worried ‚Äî and teams like the Baltimore Ravens, Seattle Seahawks, Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins and Green Bay Packers can let out a little breath ‚Äî most other teams are in the average range. The Chiefs may fall on the harder side of that range, but they still have Patrick Mahomes, an even-better defense and a 17-1 record in the last calendar year.Those things are likely to count for something."

There are eight writers, so there will be eight votes tallied for each award. In this post, I‚Äôll reveal the winners of the special teams MVP award, the most improved Chief award and the most valuable assistant coach award for the first nine games of the season.Check back Thursday for our top rookies and Friday for our MVP, offensive player of the first half and defensive player of the first half.Here are our initial winners:Kick returner/gunner Byron Pringle and punter Tommy TownsendWith four votes apiece, Byron Pringle and Tommy Townsend split the special teams MVP award.Pringle is a staple on each of the kickoff, kick-return, punt and punt-return units. Overall, he has the sixth-most special teams snaps on the team, and he‚Äôs made a few of the unit‚Äôs biggest plays this season. He scored on a 103-yard kick return in Week 7 against the Denver Broncos, and he has downed multiple punts inside the 20-yard line this year as a gunner.Townsend is an underappreciated offseason addition, replacing one of the league‚Äôs all-time punters in Dustin Colquitt. The undrafted rookie has been effective in the field-position game this year; 10 of his 27 punts have been downed inside the 20-yard line ‚Äî including two downed inside the 10-yard line in the past three games. He also executed a fake punt against the Jets that set up a key offensive touchdown.Left guard Nick Allegretti and linebacker Anthony HitchensOthers receiving votes: Cornerback Rashad Fenton, wide receiver Mecole Hardman, tight end Travis Kelce and wide receiver/kick returner Byron PringleNick Allegretti and Anthony Hitchens tied for this award by each receiving two votes.Allegretti makes a lot of sense for this title. After playing in a handful of snaps in his rookie season, the second-year, seventh-round selection was forced to step into the lineup in Week 6 due to injury. He hasn‚Äôt been out of the starting five since, and he has played noticeably well. His road-grading style is the closest any Chiefs lineman plays to injured left guard Kelechi Osemele, and he has been significant to the offense.Hitchens is also a very worthy award-winner. He‚Äôs taken a lot of heat from followers of the Chiefs for not producing up to the standard set by his contract ‚Äî but in his second year with defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, he looks more comfortable. He looks quicker to his assignments and puts himself in a better position to make a strong tackle than he has at times before. He‚Äôs always been the brain of the defense, but his improvements in reaction time and fundamentals have made him an even more invaluable part of the unit.Defensive backs/cornerbacks coach Sam MadisonOthers receiving votes: Offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, defensive line coach Brendan Daly, offensive line coach Andy Heck and defensive coordinator Steve SpagnuoloAmong an incredibly talented and respected coaching staff, Sam Madison was voted the most valuable with four votes. No other coach received more than one.It‚Äôs obvious why Madison is getting some love. He‚Äôs developed a young defensive secondary to produce as one of the league‚Äôs best units ‚Äî all this while juggling suspensions and injuries to key players.Rookie fourth-round cornerback L‚ÄôJarius Sneed led the NFL in interceptions when he suffered the broken collarbone, second-year cornerback Rashad Fenton has really impressed at times when he‚Äôs been asked to, and veteran cornerback Bashaud Breeland picked up where he left off from last year after serving his four-game suspension.Cornerback Charvarius Ward has had his ups and downs, but it sure seems like Madison is getting the most out of him and the rest of the group. It‚Äôs also important to note how big an impact the safety position has made on the defense since his arrival with Spagnuolo."

I gave my midseason vote to Mahomes.Know Your Role: Underrated Chiefs Players Looking To Stay Hot | Full Press CoverageBashaud Breeland, CornerbackJust in pass coverage, Breeland has the best completion percentage allowed on Kansas City‚Äôs defense (47.6%). Meanwhile, Pro Football Focus has him ranked second among cornerbacks in passer rating allowed (24.3). He can be an asset in man coverage, because of his physical style and length. Even against the run, Breeland is one of the Chiefs better tackling defensive backs. Last year we saw glimpses of how important he could be on the outside from time to time. However, this season has seen more steady play. Breeland has been less penalized in pass coverage reps, and his game changing plays have been more consistent. In order to continue his hot start, the Chiefs must continue to let Breeland stay on top of routes. Whether it is in man or zone, he can clamp on a route sufficiently, as long as he uses his length and keeps his feet active.NFL Predictions Against the Spread Week 11: Chiefs get revenge on Raiders | Pro Football NetworkKansas City Chiefs (-7.0) @ Las Vegas Raiders (+7.0)The last time these two teams met, the Las Vegas Raiders went into Arrowhead Stadium and handed the Kansas City Chiefs their first defeat of the season with a 40-32 win. Can the Raiders do it again, or will the Chiefs gain revenge and increase their advantage in the AFC West?Josh Jacobs rushed for two touchdowns in the first game, and shutting him down will be essential if the Chiefs want to emerge from Sunday Night Football with the victory. The Kansas City run defense has allowed the fifth-most rushing yards per game, while playing well against the pass. The Raiders have allowed the seventh-most passing yards per game, and Patrick Mahomes should be able to orchestrate the win that alluded the Chiefs earlier in the year.NFL predictions against the spread for Week 11 Sunday Night Football: The Chiefs get their revenge with a push on the spread.Final score predictions: Kansas City Chiefs 35 Las Vegas Raiders 28Every NFL Team‚Äôs Most Improved Player in 2020 | Bleacher ReportKansas City Chiefs: WR Mecole HardmanMecole Hardman was a bit of a one-trick pony in his rookie season with the Chiefs. The speedster would essentially just run go routes down the sideline or flares to the flats as Andy Reid wanted to take shots with him over the top.In 2020, he‚Äôs run a more advanced route tree and has seen an uptick in production because of it.A look at his Week 8 route chart from Next Gen Stats reveals a player who is being used to attack all areas of the field as a receiver rather than just a ‚Äúspeed guy.‚Äù The result was a seven-catch, 96-yard performance with a touchdown against the New York Jets.On the season, he‚Äôs already just one catch away from matching his total. His per-catch stats aren‚Äôt as gaudy as they were last season, but he‚Äôs proving to be a reliable target capable of big plays. The Chiefs would be wise to give him more time over Demarcus Robinson at this point.Rivera: Alex Smith has proven he is ‚Äòback‚Äô, has chance to be the guy beyond 2020 | NFL.comWashington coach Ron Rivera told reporters Monday he thinks Smith has completed his journey from gruesome leg injury, complications from surgery that nearly cost him his limb, grueling rehab and finally, a return to an NFL field as a starting quarterback. Smith‚Äôs performance in Washington‚Äôs Week 10 loss to Detroit ‚Äî in which the quarterback completed 38 of 55 passes for 390 yards ‚Äî proved it to the veteran coach.‚ÄúThat he‚Äôs pretty much back,‚Äù Rivera said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still some things that he still has to work on, and he knows that, and he‚Äôll continue to work on them, but this really was his first full week of work.

On Monday, the State Attorney‚Äôs office dropped the charges against Baker and charged South Florida attorney William Dean with extortion. Per several reports, Dean told Baker‚Äôs attorney that his clients ‚Äî three men who recanted statements last week accusing Baker of victimizing them in a robbery ‚Äî would do ‚Äúanything you want, so long as the money is right,‚Äù and attempted to extract $266,000 per client from Baker.Baker‚Äôs attorney, Bradford Cohen, released a statement to NFL.com and indicated that his client is seeking a return to the NFL. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been saying this from Day 1, that this was an extortion scheme and that Deandre was the victim. This event did not play out as they insinuated. And the case was dismissed,‚Äù Cohen said. ‚ÄúDeandre has been working out since the day of this event. He knew he was innocent of the crime. He‚Äôs been working out in case he gets signed by a team.‚ÄùBaker was formally charged in August with four counts of robbery with a firearm. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Quinton Dunbar, who was also alleged to have been involved in the incident, was not charged at the time.NFL Week 10 winners and losers, plus grades for every game, the wild ‚ÄòHail Murray,‚Äô and Vikings-Bears preview | CBS SportsRyan WilsonWinner: Brian Flores and the Dolphins. I‚Äôm starting to think Ryan has a man-crush on the Dolphins, because for the second straight week, they are his winner. Wilson has been highly impressed with their defense and he‚Äôs starting to feel like they‚Äôre a lock to make the playoffs, which is saying a lot, considering this team started 0-7 just last season.Loser: Ravens. After being upset by the Patriots, the Ravens have likely squandered any chance they had of winning the AFC North. Not only are they now three games behind the Steelers, but they‚Äôre also tied with the Browns for second place in the division.Chiefs playoff picture: Beat the Raiders editionGetting a first-round byeThis is the time of year where we would normally say that a team with an 8-1 record controls its own destiny to land a postseason bye ‚Äî that is, if they win the rest of their games, they‚Äôll be assured of a week off to begin the postseason. But since the NFL‚Äôs expanded playoff format now allows only one team to get a bye ‚Äî and the Steelers now stand 9-0 after defeating the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday ‚Äî it‚Äôs not that simple.Should the Chiefs take care of business ‚Äî finishing the season 7-0 ‚Äî they‚Äôll have a 91% chance to land the #1 seed. Given that 7-0 finish, Steelers losses to the Ravens in Week 12 (or the Buffalo Bills in Week 14) would clinch a Chiefs bye. Of course, other Steelers losses would improve the Chiefs‚Äô chance to claim the top spot ‚Äî but by themselves, only losses to the Ravens or Bills (combined with a Chiefs 7-0 finish) would clinch it.But that also means any Chiefs loss would make getting a bye significantly more difficult. In terms of the bye, the best-case Kansas City loss would be to the Falcons in Week 16. With that 6-1 record to finish the season, the Chiefs would need that Week 14 Bills win (or the Week 12 Ravens win and at least one more Steelers loss) to clinch the bye."

I gave my midseason vote to Mahomes.Know Your Role: Underrated Chiefs Players Looking To Stay Hot | Full Press CoverageBashaud Breeland, CornerbackJust in pass coverage, Breeland has the best completion percentage allowed on Kansas City‚Äôs defense (47.6%). Meanwhile, Pro Football Focus has him ranked second among cornerbacks in passer rating allowed (24.3). He can be an asset in man coverage, because of his physical style and length. Even against the run, Breeland is one of the Chiefs better tackling defensive backs. Last year we saw glimpses of how important he could be on the outside from time to time. However, this season has seen more steady play. Breeland has been less penalized in pass coverage reps, and his game changing plays have been more consistent. In order to continue his hot start, the Chiefs must continue to let Breeland stay on top of routes. Whether it is in man or zone, he can clamp on a route sufficiently, as long as he uses his length and keeps his feet active.NFL Predictions Against the Spread Week 11: Chiefs get revenge on Raiders | Pro Football NetworkKansas City Chiefs (-7.0) @ Las Vegas Raiders (+7.0)The last time these two teams met, the Las Vegas Raiders went into Arrowhead Stadium and handed the Kansas City Chiefs their first defeat of the season with a 40-32 win. Can the Raiders do it again, or will the Chiefs gain revenge and increase their advantage in the AFC West?Josh Jacobs rushed for two touchdowns in the first game, and shutting him down will be essential if the Chiefs want to emerge from Sunday Night Football with the victory. The Kansas City run defense has allowed the fifth-most rushing yards per game, while playing well against the pass. The Raiders have allowed the seventh-most passing yards per game, and Patrick Mahomes should be able to orchestrate the win that alluded the Chiefs earlier in the year.NFL predictions against the spread for Week 11 Sunday Night Football: The Chiefs get their revenge with a push on the spread.Final score predictions: Kansas City Chiefs 35 Las Vegas Raiders 28Every NFL Team‚Äôs Most Improved Player in 2020 | Bleacher ReportKansas City Chiefs: WR Mecole HardmanMecole Hardman was a bit of a one-trick pony in his rookie season with the Chiefs. The speedster would essentially just run go routes down the sideline or flares to the flats as Andy Reid wanted to take shots with him over the top.In 2020, he‚Äôs run a more advanced route tree and has seen an uptick in production because of it.A look at his Week 8 route chart from Next Gen Stats reveals a player who is being used to attack all areas of the field as a receiver rather than just a ‚Äúspeed guy.‚Äù The result was a seven-catch, 96-yard performance with a touchdown against the New York Jets.On the season, he‚Äôs already just one catch away from matching his total. His per-catch stats aren‚Äôt as gaudy as they were last season, but he‚Äôs proving to be a reliable target capable of big plays. The Chiefs would be wise to give him more time over Demarcus Robinson at this point.Rivera: Alex Smith has proven he is ‚Äòback‚Äô, has chance to be the guy beyond 2020 | NFL.comWashington coach Ron Rivera told reporters Monday he thinks Smith has completed his journey from gruesome leg injury, complications from surgery that nearly cost him his limb, grueling rehab and finally, a return to an NFL field as a starting quarterback. Smith‚Äôs performance in Washington‚Äôs Week 10 loss to Detroit ‚Äî in which the quarterback completed 38 of 55 passes for 390 yards ‚Äî proved it to the veteran coach.‚ÄúThat he‚Äôs pretty much back,‚Äù Rivera said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still some things that he still has to work on, and he knows that, and he‚Äôll continue to work on them, but this really was his first full week of work. But I think that he‚Äôs proven that he‚Äôs back as the player, and again, that‚Äôs something that we‚Äôre going to most certainly discuss going forward.‚ÄùDeAndre Baker has charges dropped as attorney charged with extortion; ex-Giant seeks NFL return | CBS SportsBaker was released by the Giants this past offseason due to his alleged involvement in an armed robbery in Florida. On Monday, the State Attorney‚Äôs office dropped the charges against Baker and charged South Florida attorney William Dean with extortion. Per several reports, Dean told Baker‚Äôs attorney that his clients ‚Äî three men who recanted statements last week accusing Baker of victimizing them in a robbery ‚Äî would do ‚Äúanything you want, so long as the money is right,‚Äù and attempted to extract $266,000 per client from Baker.Baker‚Äôs attorney, Bradford Cohen, released a statement to NFL.com and indicated that his client is seeking a return to the NFL. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been saying this from Day 1, that this was an extortion scheme and that Deandre was the victim. This event did not play out as they insinuated. And the case was dismissed,‚Äù Cohen said. ‚ÄúDeandre has been working out since the day of this event. He knew he was innocent of the crime. He‚Äôs been working out in case he gets signed by a team.‚ÄùBaker was formally charged in August with four counts of robbery with a firearm. Seattle Seahawks cornerback Quinton Dunbar, who was also alleged to have been involved in the incident, was not charged at the time.NFL Week 10 winners and losers, plus grades for every game, the wild ‚ÄòHail Murray,‚Äô and Vikings-Bears preview | CBS SportsRyan WilsonWinner: Brian Flores and the Dolphins. I‚Äôm starting to think Ryan has a man-crush on the Dolphins, because for the second straight week, they are his winner. Wilson has been highly impressed with their defense and he‚Äôs starting to feel like they‚Äôre a lock to make the playoffs, which is saying a lot, considering this team started 0-7 just last season.Loser: Ravens. After being upset by the Patriots, the Ravens have likely squandered any chance they had of winning the AFC North. Not only are they now three games behind the Steelers, but they‚Äôre also tied with the Browns for second place in the division.Chiefs playoff picture: Beat the Raiders editionGetting a first-round byeThis is the time of year where we would normally say that a team with an 8-1 record controls its own destiny to land a postseason bye ‚Äî that is, if they win the rest of their games, they‚Äôll be assured of a week off to begin the postseason. But since the NFL‚Äôs expanded playoff format now allows only one team to get a bye ‚Äî and the Steelers now stand 9-0 after defeating the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday ‚Äî it‚Äôs not that simple.Should the Chiefs take care of business ‚Äî finishing the season 7-0 ‚Äî they‚Äôll have a 91% chance to land the #1 seed. Given that 7-0 finish, Steelers losses to the Ravens in Week 12 (or the Buffalo Bills in Week 14) would clinch a Chiefs bye. Of course, other Steelers losses would improve the Chiefs‚Äô chance to claim the top spot ‚Äî but by themselves, only losses to the Ravens or Bills (combined with a Chiefs 7-0 finish) would clinch it.But that also means any Chiefs loss would make getting a bye significantly more difficult. In terms of the bye, the best-case Kansas City loss would be to the Falcons in Week 16. With that 6-1 record to finish the season, the Chiefs would need that Week 14 Bills win (or the Week 12 Ravens win and at least one more Steelers loss) to clinch the bye.https://t.co/mxEV1iYAcK"

The 2019 first-round pick is headed there for a visit, as @NYPost_Schwartz noted. That‚Äôs the only planned visit and, barring a snag, he‚Äôll be a Chief.Garafolo added that Baker‚Äôs stay on the practice squad is expected to be short-lived. Once he ‚Äúgets up to speed,‚Äù he will be activated to the 53-man roster. We first learned earlier on Tuesday that Baker would be ‚Äúheading to Kansas City‚Äù to meet with the Chiefs ‚Äî according to a report from the New York Post.Former Giants CB DeAndre Baker is in New Jersey today cleaning up his affairs.
He is headed to Kansas City tomorrow morning to meet with the Chiefs, according to a source.Baker, 23, first entered the league in 2019 when the Giants selected him with the 30th overall pick in the NFL Draft. The 5-foot-11, 188-pound cornerback registered 61 tackles (48 solo) and eight passes defensed in 15 games for New York.Our defensive film analyst, Craig Stout, chimed in with a breakdown of why the Chiefs might see him as a fit in Kansas City.STOUT: Baker‚Äôs fit in Kansas City will be interesting, compared to some of the other players they‚Äôve focused on developing during Spagnuolo‚Äôs tenure. Baker‚Äôs build and athletic profile most closely matches up to Rashad Fenton‚Äôs ‚Äî who Spagnuolo plays primarily in the slot. Fenton is a good zone cornerback that Spagnuolo rotates deep and into space often.Meanwhile, Baker is more of a press-man guy who isn‚Äôt great in zone. Playing that role hasn‚Äôt been his forte throughout his collegiate and professional career. Baker could definitely play on the outside ‚Äî where he‚Äôs most comfortable ‚Äî as a press-man cornerback with ball skills. However, that‚Äôs where the Chiefs have gone to longer, faster players such as L‚ÄôJarius Sneed and BoPete Keyes).Defensive back and cornerbacks coach Sam Madison and Spagnuolo have both gushed about needing that. Baker would break against that, and he hasn‚Äôt been particularly successful there. In his rookie season in 2019, Baker allowed 54 completions on 88 targets (61.4%) for 850 yards and six touchdowns. By comparison, Charvarius Ward and Bashaud Breeland allowed a combined 72 catches on 151 targets (47.6%) for 1,118 yards and six touchdowns that same year.Kansas City‚Äôs locker room certainly has the players to contain any character or work ethic concerns, so the risk is minimal ‚Äî especially for the amount of money Baker will likely cost. If the Chiefs are looking for a stash-and-save cornerback candidate for the 2021 roster, they might be able to maximize his potential and catch a good, cheap player to help round out their defensive back room.As Craig mentioned, there may be character concerns to work through with the former first-rounder, as the Giants waived him back in early September as Baker went through significant legal troubles. At the time, Baker cleared waivers and was placed on the commissioner‚Äôs exempt list.Baker was being prosecuted on four counts of robbery with a firearm that stemmed from an incident that occurred in May. However, on Tuesday, the Broward State Attorney‚Äôs Office dropped all charges against Baker when the attorney for the alleged victims was charged with extortion.Spoke with Bradford Cohen, lawyer for ex-#Giants CB Deandre Baker: ""I‚Äôve been saying this from Day 1, that this was an extortion scheme and that Deandre was the victim. This event did not play out as they insinuated. And the case was dismissed.""From NFL on Deandre Baker: ‚ÄúWe have been monitoring all developments in the matter which remains under review of the NFL‚Äôs Personal Conduct Policy. Baker remains subject to discipline based on results of that investigation.""The Giants showed little interest in reuniting with Baker when asked on Tuesday, but the Chiefs are looking to be the team that will grant him his next opportunity in the NFL."

Mahomes will win MVP and Chase Young will be Defensive Rookie of the Year. Offensive Player of the Year should also be Mahomes seeing that he plays offense, but will go to Dalvin Cook as it evolves into an award that excludes quarterbacks (which is good since there will never be another non-quarterback MVP). Offensive Rookie of the Year will eventually go to Joe Burrow due to his inferior supporting cast (though Justin Herbert‚Äôs group really isn‚Äôt that much better). T.J. Watt will stake his claim to Defensive Player of the Year, while Myles Garrett will fall to the second tier‚Äîhe‚Äôll never in his life face the run of incompetent offensive line play he saw in Weeks 2 through 5 this season.

It‚Äôs a week-to-week league, and how we prepare, how we practice, how we walk-through is a direct correlation to how we play. They understand that. ...

When that position is also one where the team is notably thin, it‚Äôs massive. For this Chiefs team to become a dynasty, it will need great value at some positions where they aren‚Äôt able to invest significant assets. From what we‚Äôve seen so far of Sneed, assuming he returns to the field after the bye and keeps on his current trajectory, he has the best value on the entire roster.Tershawn Wharton: A close second when it comes to relative value is undrafted free agent-turned-defensive line stud, Turk Wharton. Wharton is showing an explosive first step when rushing the passer and grown-man strength when playing the run. Coming from a small school and stepping right into a difficult position is a remarkable feat. The Chiefs clearly got a steal in Wharton.GLOBAL HOPKINS"

This was a good one:Some needs could be met in free agency, but it‚Äôs not likely that happens with potential cap space restrictions. That leads us to address them in the draft.Here are some positions the Chiefs could prioritize early in April 2021:The three interior positions are all up for grabs in 2021. Some may point to the return of Laurent Duvernay-Tardif as a means to solidify the group, but he will be 18 months removed from football the next time he sees the field ‚Äî and he wasn‚Äôt particularly good in 2019. Austin Reiter is a free agent, as is Daniel Kilgore. Center could be a logical addition early on in the draft.The depth of the defensive end group is non-existent in 2021. Alex Okafor, Taco Charlton and Tanoh Kpassagnon are all free agents. The Chiefs need to bolster that group ‚Äî especially considering the lack of a pass rush to this point in the season. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to add an early pick to provide legitimate juice off the edge so Steve Spagnuolo doesn‚Äôt have to try so hard to manufacture pressure. The front four needs to be more consistent ‚Äî adding early talent will help that.Sammy Watkins and Demarcus Robinson are free agents next season ‚Äî the Chiefs will need to continue to stockpile weapons for Patrick Mahomes. This is a strong wide receiver class, and there should be talent throughout day one and two that makes sense in Andy Reid‚Äôs offense. They need to identify a direct replacement for Watkins ‚Äî an ‚ÄúX‚Äù receiver who can beat press coverage and catch balls in traffic in the middle of the field.Mitch Schwartz has missed several games this season and isn‚Äôt getting any younger. Eric Fisher will be entering the final year of his contract in 2021. Do not be surprised if the Chiefs take a tackle early in the draft this season. Lucas Niang was a top-100 selection for the team last year and is a promising prospect that should help the position. They still probably need another in the long term.Luckily for the Chiefs, the wide receiver, tackle and defensive end groups all look very strong in this year‚Äôs draft. Chiefs general manager Brett Veach should be able to find quality talent in day one and two of the draft that could contribute sooner rather than later. It‚Äôs aligning well for the Chiefs.Arrowhead Pride podcasts are available on Amazon Alexa, Apple, Google, Spotify and Stitcher.

He‚Äôs second in the NFL in both passing yards and passing touchdowns, thrown an interception on the lowest percentage of his pass attempts ‚Äî and is in the top three in both passer rating and ESPN‚Äôs QBR metric.Mahomes has his blow up games ‚Äî like the 385 passing yards and five total touchdowns against the Baltimore Ravens or the 416 yards and five scores through the air on the New York Jets. Mahomes has also had not-as-flashy games ‚Äî like the 211 yards and three touchdowns against the Houston Texans in the season opener, which was a performance that his backup quarterbacks Matt Moore and Chad Henne called ‚Äúone of the best game he‚Äôs played.‚ÄùBut unlike this season‚Äôs other league MVP candidates, Mahomes has yet to have a letdown game riddled with turnovers and negative plays. In the only game the Chiefs lost this season, the defense gave up 40 points and 490 total yards to the Las Vegas Raiders. Mahomes did commit his only turnover of the season late in the fourth quarter ‚Äî but because of their inability to get off the field, the defense holds most of the the blame for that loss.Mahomes has been as efficient and effective as ever. Opposing defenses are giving him lots of different looks to try and confuse him ‚Äî but no matter what he‚Äôs seen, he‚Äôs executed. By season‚Äôs end, he‚Äôll be as worthy a league MVP candidate as any other player.Tight end Travis KelceOthers receiving votes: Wide receiver Tyreek HillKelce received seven votes. Tyreek Hill also received a vote.Kelce has been Mahomes‚Äô most consistent, reliable target. He leads Chiefs receivers in targets, receptions and yards. According to PFF, Kelce is the Chiefs‚Äô only major contributor who hasn‚Äôt dropped a pass this season. For comparison‚Äôs sake, Hill and wide receiver Mecole Hardman have five and four, respectively.As good as you think Kelce has been this year, he‚Äôs been better. In his eighth season, he‚Äôs easily on track to earn his third first-team All-Pro award ‚Äî his third in five seasons. Tight end Rob Gronkowski has earned four such awards during his career.So far, Kelce leads all NFL tight ends in the these categories:During the two-game home stand preceding the bye week, Kelce finished strong, totaling18 catches for 271 yards and a score. He continues to be one of the league‚Äôs most dominant players ‚Äî and given the chemistry he has with Mahomes, the record for most yards by a tight end in one season might again be within his reach. In 2018, he held it for a few hours before San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle bested him .He‚Äôd have to pick up the pace a little bit ‚Äî but not much. He‚Äôs on track to finish with 1,367 yards ‚Äî ten short of the record Kittle set in 2018.Defensive tackle Chris JonesOthers receiving votes: Safety Tyrann Mathieu, defensive tackle Derrick Nnadi, safety Daniel SorensenJones received five votes for his play so far. Mathieu received two votes for his efforts, while Nnadi and Sorensen each earned one.While the defense has had its ups and downs this season, Jones has consistently been disruptive to opposing offenses. His pass-rushing dominance continues to be as fun to watch as it is significant to the unit‚Äôs success. He leads the entire unit in quarterback pressures, sacks and forced fumbles ‚Äî and has missed only one game this season. Among all NFL defenders, he has the ninth-most pressures and the third-most quarterback hits.His performance has been noticeable because he often seems to be the only defensive lineman who can create true quarterback pressure throughout a game. He leads all of his teammates by ten pressures ‚Äî and most of them have played in one more game than he has.Jones‚Äô teammates will need to step up to achieve the pass rush unit‚Äôs full potential. With the way he‚Äôs playing, an uptick of performance from defensive end Frank Clark (and other linemen) could quickly turn the Chiefs‚Äô front four into the league‚Äôs most-feared pass rushers."

That‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at.‚ÄùAs to be expected by now, Reid downplayed any added motivation to beat the Raiders other than it being a division game.‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs two good football teams playing each other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think probably either team likes each other that much as they stated before, so we get ourselves ready to play against a good football team. I think that‚Äôs most important.‚ÄùRaiders head coach Jon Gruden was also asked about the ‚Äúvictory lap‚Äù on Monday.Gruden‚Äôs response pic.twitter.com/Qak2yjFojV‚ÄúI mean, you could find a smart-aleck bus driver in Kansas City who made some snide comments when we got on the bus.

To be ranked on the 'career' record list in the NFL a passer must have 1,500 attempts.He should hit that milestone during the Denver game - outside shot at the prior game in Tampa if everybody starts deciding to stop the KC run game.I'm not sure how many lists he'll be #1 on after that - but career rating is virtually in the bag.

324,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/2/21537091/kansas-city-chiefs-pat-mahomes-andy-reid,The top 5 greatest duos in Chiefs franchise history,"FILED UNDER:From Willie Lanier and Jim Lynch to Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid, these duos have personified teamwork with the Chiefs.The essence of a great football team is partnership ‚Äî the willingness to fight for one another. The Kansas City Chiefs have been around since 1960, when they were founded by Lamar Hunt as the Dallas Texans.In 1963, then-Kansas City Mayor H. Roe Bartle convinced Hunt to move the team to the Midwest, where he guaranteed the team would triple the season-ticket base. Within three months, the ticket goal was achieved, and the Texans moved to Kansas City, becoming the Chiefs.But that duo of Hunt and Bartle was only the first memorable tandem in Chiefs history. There would be plenty more duos to come over the next 57 years ‚Äî and several that would specifically help lead the franchise to Super Bowl championships in 1969 and 2019.These are the top five duos in the history of the Kansas City Chiefs.BY JOHN DIXONJust on the basis of their play on the field, you might place Lanier with fellow Chiefs linebacker Bobby Bell. Both played on the 1969 championship and richly deserved their inductions into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But we instead choose to pair him with the other linebacker from that 1969 squad; it says so much more about the team ‚Äî and the era in which they played.Both Lanier and Lynch were selected as middle linebackers in the second round of 1967‚Äôs AFL Draft. Only Lynch was well known, having played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. In contrast, Lanier had played for Morgan State in Baltimore, Maryland ‚Äî and according to the story Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt told at Lanier‚Äôs Hall of Fame enshrinement, no one from the Chiefs had actually talked to him; they had selected him solely on the word of part-time scout Frank Barnes.Despite this, by the time Lynch arrived at training camp after playing in the College All-Star game (he had won the Maxwell Award as the nation‚Äôs top college player), Lanier had already taken his job as the team‚Äôs middle linebacker ‚Äî something that was particularly shocking at a time when Black players were kept away from leadership positions.Chiefs head coach Hank Stram ‚Äî who immediately thought Lynch also deserved a starting spot, but as an outside linebacker ‚Äî put an exclamation point on his decision by announcing the two men would be roommates at training camp and on the road; at the time, assigning white and Black players to the same room was almost never done. But it was the way the Stram operated.Lynch took it all in stride, immediately recognizing that Lanier was the better player for the more prestigious position. And as roommates, the two soon discovered they had similar interests, becoming fast friends who remained together at camp and on the road through the rest of their NFL careers. Both retired after the 1977 season ‚Äî and are now enshrined in the Chiefs‚Äô Ring of Honor. With Bell, they might make up the greatest linebacker trio in NFL history.BY PETE SWEENEYThe Chiefs could not have known it at the time, but with their first-round picks in 2005 and 2006, they formed a duo in their front seven that would trouble opposing offenses for the next decade. The Chiefs selected Derrick Johnson with the 15th overall pick in 2005 and Tamba Hali with the 20th overall pick a year later.The Chiefs knew they had hit on their picks very soon after making them. The players won the franchise‚Äôs Mack Lee Hill award ‚Äî given to the team‚Äôs outstanding rookie ‚Äî in back-to-back seasons.Johnson ‚Äî born in Waco, Texas ‚Äî was a two-time consensus All-American from the University of Texas. He was named 2004‚Äôs Big 12 defensive player of the year. As a Chief, Johnson went to four Pro Bowls over 13 seasons, becoming the franchise‚Äôs all-time tackle leader.Hali escaped his home country of Liberia ‚Äî then in the midst of a civil war ‚Äî at the age of 10. Hali and his father moved to New Jersey, where he played for the high school football team and was recruited to Penn State. Similar to Johnson‚Äôs accolade, he was named the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year in 2005. He played outside linebacker in most of his seasons in Kansas City. As a Chief, Hali went to six Pro Bowls over 12 seasons and finished second ‚Äî behind only Derrick Thomas ‚Äî on the franchise‚Äôs career sack list.Together in the front seven for 12 seasons, the duo created havoc. Unfortunately, only the tail end of their tenure was met with consistent offensive success with the arrival of Andy Reid in 2013. The height of their partnership was their only playoff win in 2016, when the Chiefs ended a 22-year victory drought with a 30-0 Wild Card win over the Houston Texans.‚ÄúTamba‚Äôs been giving me a big boost since he‚Äôs stepped here in 2006,‚Äù Johnson said, via The Kansas City Star, back in 2017. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a guy that loves to play despite of what‚Äôs going on with his body (Hali was injury-riddled at the time). When he‚Äôs out there, he‚Äôs a warrior. He‚Äôs the first person I‚Äôd take in a back alley with me for sure.‚ÄùBY JOHN DIXONWhen general manager Carl Peterson and head coach Marty Schottenheimer took over the Chiefs in 1989, they were handed the keys to a franchise that had been above .500 only twice in the previous 15 seasons; under former special teams coach Frank Gansz, the team had been 4-11 during the last two.For Schottenheimer ‚Äî a former linebacker ‚Äî the first order of business was always defense. The team had already cashed in 1987‚Äôs 4-11 record by acquiring Nebraska defensive end Neil Smith with the second overall pick of the draft. Schottenheimer and Peterson used the more recent 4-11 chit to take Alabama linebacker Derrick Thomas with 1989‚Äôs fourth overall selection.Over the next eight seasons, the pair would unleash a reign of terror against opposing quarterbacks. If opposing offensive linemen could find a way to stop the 6-foot-4, 270- pound Smith, they still had to deal with Thomas‚Äô speed and athleticism around the edge; if they could keep Thomas from screaming around tackles almost horizontally ‚Äî a technique that is common today, but almost unheard-of three decades ago ‚Äî they still had Smith on their hands.During the years they played together in Kansas City, they combined for 20 sacks or more in six consecutive seasons ‚Äî including 29.5 in 1990 and 29 in 1992. In those same two seasons, they forced 10 fumbles ‚Äî while averaging 7.2 across the eight-year span. They averaged a combined 122.5 tackles during that period, leading a defense that was top-10 in points or yards in six of those seasons. Between them, they accumulated 14 Pro Bowl selections and three first-team All-Pro honors.And the Chiefs became one of the NFL‚Äôs most successful franchises, making the playoffs in six straight seasons from 1990 through 1995.Following the 1996 season, Smith left for the Denver Broncos in free agency. Thomas died tragically as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash following the 1999 season. But for fans in the early 1990s, Thomas and Smith were the Kansas City Chiefs.BY JOHN DIXONIt‚Äôs hard for younger NFL fans to fully appreciate the way the game was played before the mid-1990s, when teams were allowed to have radio receivers in their quarterbacks‚Äô helmets. Today, we still sometimes refer to quarterbacks as signal-callers ‚Äî but until the coach was in their ear, a big part of their job was deciding what the next play would be. While some plays were sent in from the sidelines when players were substituted, high-pressure situations called for a quarterback who could not only execute the plays, but also decide what they would be.And that‚Äôs how Len Dawson became quarterback of the Dallas Texans in 1962.A first-round pick out of Purdue in 1957, Dawson had languished on the benches of the NFL‚Äôs Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns for five seasons. Chiefs head coach Hank Stram needed a quarterback who could not only play the position, but run the forward-thinking offense that was beginning to take shape in his mind. In Dawson ‚Äî with whom he was familiar from his days as a Purdue assistant coach ‚Äî he believed he had found his man.With Dawson as the starter, the franchise won the AFL championship in 1962. Dawson made the AFL All-Star Game and was named a first-team All-Pro, leading the AFL in completion percentage, touchdowns, yards per attempt and passer rating. In fact, through the next seven seasons, Dawson would lead the league in passer rating in six of them.After the franchise moved to Kansas City, Stram began to implement the ideas floating around in his head ‚Äî and he and his quarterback began developing chemistry between them. Dawson not only understood what Stram was trying to create, but also how Stram wanted it to be called on the field. The two men developed a deep respect for each other ‚Äî referring to each other as ‚ÄúLeonard‚Äù and ‚ÄúHenry‚Äù ‚Äî that showed up in the team‚Äôs success.The now-famous sideline film from Super Bowl IV shows the relationship clearly. Stram isn‚Äôt telling Dawson what plays to run; he‚Äôs giving advice ‚Äî albeit strongly. And Dawson had the intelligence (and the power) to go his own way, too ‚Äî most notably in the 1969 Divisional round game against the New York Jets, as described in Michael MacCambridge‚Äôs book about the 1969 Chiefs.Flanker Otis Taylor had drawn up a play in the dirt for Dawson, believing he had found a way to beat the Jets defense. ‚ÄúAre you going to call it?‚Äù asked Taylor. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù replied Dawson. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to wait until we get in the huddle, so everybody can hear, and then I‚Äôm gonna call the play.‚Äù Taylor gained 61 yards, setting up the final score in the Chiefs‚Äô 13-6 victory.Stram and Dawson‚Äôs partnership led to three AFL championships and two Super Bowl appearances. The last one ‚Äî a 23-7 drubbing of the Minnesota Vikings ‚Äî firmly established that the AFL had arrived.BY PETE SWEENEYThe franchise was forever changed back in 2017 when, with the 10th overall pick, the Chiefs selected Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes after a trade up with the Buffalo Bills.Considering the Chiefs already had a successful quarterback in Alex Smith, it was a bold move. Smith had led the Chiefs to a 41-20 record from 2013-16 and then ‚Äî while tutoring Mahomes about how to be a professional ‚Äî had the best statistical season of his career in 2017. The Chiefs still traded Smith to Washington during the 2018 offseason, making it Mahomes‚Äô team.As a first-year starter under the guidance of Andy Reid, Mahomes threw for 50 touchdowns and 12 interceptions en route to being named the franchise‚Äôs first Associated Press NFL MVP. The Chiefs came up just short of the Super Bowl, losing to the New England Patriots in the AFC title game, but the team would be right back in the mix next year.Mahomes‚Äô regular-season statistics took a hit in 2019 due to lingering injuries throughout the season. But healthy for the playoffs, Mahomes dazzled, throwing for 10 touchdowns and two interceptions in three games ‚Äî including the franchise‚Äôs first Super Bowl title in 50 years.Reid and Mahomes take our top slot on this list for a simple reason: They don‚Äôt seem anywhere close to done. Mahomes agreed to a 10-year contract with the team this offseason, and Reid reportedly extended his deal through 2025. Mahomes realizes he would not be the same player under someone else, and after 20 seasons a head coach, Reid knows he has finally found his man.Early in the 2020 season, Mahomes became the fastest quarterback in NFL history to reach the 90-touchdown plateau (37 games), passing Dan Marino (40), and the Reid-Mahomes duo has already done something Marino never could.During press conferences, we‚Äôve slowly watched how Mahomes has adopted the Reid way. In-house matters are to stay in house, and lofty goals are to be kept to themselves. Actions speak louder than words.But those guidelines don‚Äôt apply to the kicker.‚ÄúI just think with Patrick as a quarterback and seeing his work ethic and his drive, there is going to be no letting up and take our foot off this gas pedal,‚Äù said Harrison Butker this offseason. ‚ÄúAnd obviously, with coach Reid at the top, he‚Äôs already been talking about how he‚Äôs studying film and getting ready for next year and trying to do it again, so I think we just have the culture in our facility ‚Äî it‚Äôs just that we‚Äôre going to put our head down, work hard, keep doing our thing. We know what works to win games. We know that process, and we‚Äôre just going to repeat it and hopefully get a couple more rings.‚ÄùReid and Mahomes have won 30-plus regular-season games and a Lombardi Trophy ‚Äî and the best part? There is more to come."

On Friday, we will announce our MVP, offensive player and defensive player honors.In this post, we will highlight the most valuable rookies to the team on each side of the ball ‚Äî as voted on by all eight Arrowhead Pride staff members.Running back Clyde Edwards-HelaireA clean sweep for Clyde Edwards-Helaire ‚Äî who is the only rookie on the offensive side of the ball that has taken more than a handful of snaps. Undrafted rookie right tackle Yasir Durant made his debut this past week against the Carolina Panthers.As obvious as it is that he deserves the team‚Äôs offensive rookie of the year, he needs to have more consideration for the league award.I understand the emergence of rookie quarterbacks Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, and Tua Tagovailoa makes it impossible for Edwards-Helaire to win. That being said, other rookies like Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson, Jacksonville Jaguars running back James Robinson and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Chase Claypool have better odds or the same odds to win the award as the Chiefs running back.They‚Äôve all had great debut seasons, but let‚Äôs look at Edwards-Helaire‚Äôs season at the halfway point:Among NFL rookies, he is:It‚Äôs a very talented class of rookie running backs and wide receivers, but I believe Edwards-Helaire should be considered the top rookie behind the three impressive quarterbacks.Defensive tackle Tershawn WhartonOthers receiving votes: Cornerback L‚ÄôJarius SneedUndrafted rookie Turk Wharton received six votes to claim the award ‚Äî while injured rookie L‚ÄôJarius Sneed earned two votes for his three-game stretch at the beginning of the year.Wharton has played a role all season ‚Äî but recently, he has become one of the biggest contributors on the defensive line. He‚Äôs played the fourth-most snaps among Chiefs defensive linemen in the past four games. Of that group, he has the third-most pressures and the second-most run stops in that span, per PFF. He‚Äôs also the only defensive lineman to force a fumble in that stretch.He seems to make at least one big play a game, and that has translated into having one of the most impressive defensive rookie seasons in the NFL this year.Chase Young continues to live up to the hype pic.twitter.com/1ugibdIr57It is worth the reminder that Wharton was playing football at Missouri University of Science & Technology in Rolla, Missouri at this time last year. He dominated that level, but no one predicted that he would impact the Chiefs defense the way he immediately has. The COVID-19 pandemic kept Wharton a secret through the offseason and in training camp, but it‚Äôs obvious that general manager Brett Veach found a gem and should receiver proper credit.With star pass rusher Chris Jones looking as disruptive as ever, defensive tackles Derrick Nnadi, Mike Pennel and Wharton have all proven to be trustworthy on the interior. The depth the Chiefs possess on the interior defensive line is important for the last half of the year, but injuries have impacted their defensive end depth."

The touchdown would've given the Falcons the lead but by less than a touchdown score. The Falcons would have rather run the clock down to one second left, kick a gimme field goal, and win the game. Gurley realized the Lions were letting him score so he slowed up close to the goal line, but his momentum carried him barely to the white stripe, giving the Falcons the points -- but leaving lots of time on the clock for the Lions' Matthew Stafford to matriculate the ball down the field and throw the game winning touchdown pass with no time left.This idea of not scoring a touchdown for some advantage fascinates me, and I've written about it before at Arrowhead Pride.Watching the Jets game today I started to have another thought. I thought, this Mahomes thing is so phenomenally daunting to defend, it seems the only way to stop it is to keep Mahomes off the field by successfully running offensive plays that grind as much clock as possible. This has the added benefit of getting the defense really tired so it is easier to keep up with Mahomes' prodigious scoring efforts as the game goes on.::Ding!::Think about this: If you're the other team, why not just let Mahomes throw touchdown passes every time the Chiefs go on the field on offense? First play, every time? Think about it. Chiefs first play from scrimmage, 75-yard touchdown pass to Hill. Now you get the ball and if you have a decent running game and a quarterback who is sharp enough to hit those occasional short range passes in the middle of the field, then you match Mahomes with another score but consume five or six minutes of game time to do it.Chiefs get the ball back, you send the defense out there to pretend to rush Mahomes and cover the receivers, and ::BOOM:: another 75-yard touchdown pass, oh, this time to Robinson. Hey, Mahomes likes to mix it up.Right away the Chiefs defense is back on the field. They've barely had a chance to catch their breath.Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat...Sounds crazy, I know. You've really got to have that decent running game and that sharp quarterback -- he doesn't have to be great, just good enough. In the first half of today's game the Jets kept things somewhat close -- and this was the Jets! They couldn't score a touchdown in their opponents' end if their lives depended on it. But if it was the now rejuvenated Dolphins, the still dangerous Saints, the surprising Raiders (with a fine running game that soundly beat us in our only loss) the Tom Brady-led Buccaneers -- all teams we still must play this season -- or even worse, a team like the Steelers or Seahawks we'll likely meet in the postseason, what of it?...Look at the Chiefs defense right now. Its main weakness is its run defense. Sometimes our linebackers have fine games. Hitchens and Wilson can shine often enough, and Willie Gay is starting to show his game. But if we are facing a strong running attack and we lose the battle in the trenches...Thing is it's happened before. Face it, a lot of our games are too close because the other team has some advantageous time of possession, and I feel the pain myself watching a totally gassed Chiefs defensive unit swooning there on the sideline. Think about that pain at 50:00 opponents' time of possession. My goodness, our D would be an infirmary ward in the middle of the 4th quarter and then after their D (very well rested by the way) can make one key stop on Mahomes, just one, we can forget about it.Is this idea lost on the opponents?Yes, it sounds crazy. I really can't imagine anyone trying it, I really can't. There are too many variables to sustain it throughout the day -- you'd have to be perfect on offense for each time your defense parts the Red Sea for Mahomeses to take his people through to the promised land. You'd have to have no turnovers. You'd have to score a touchdown on every possession.But what if some version of it were employed in some way?Of course the even more insane eventuality is that the Chiefs catch on to this and they themselves challenge the other team to have to tackle them when they run vanilla plays so they themselves don't score too quickly. But then that's just the twisted nature of this whole thing.Let's assume it is employed in its fullest sense. Chiefs possessions would start to look like the Pro Bowl. Chiefs backs running harmlessly into defenders and falling down after a half-hearted attempt at a tackle ---- if even that.I can just hear Mitch now, ""Snap to Mahomes, and he steps back and stands there. The pass rushers are jostling about, annnd, now they decide to break out a deck of cards and play canasta with the O-linemen until Mahomes decides to just go ahead and score. Well, wait, someone's got to make him try to do something with the ball or he'll just stroll around out out there for the rest of the game, so the safety comes up to him and asks him kindly to either run 75 yards for a touchdown or just let him sack him...""Whatever you think about this craziness, one thing is for sure.This Mahomes thing is unprecedented, it really is. For us to actually have this idea waddle its way into our brains, well at least mine, just the thought, is really something. It just says everything about the impact this kid has had on the game. And even though it is just my thought, I really do think there is something to it as crazy as it sounds.Have you had even the slightest thought like this? I can't believe at least a few others haven't.Just a thought.This is a FanPost and does not necessarily reflect the views of Arrowhead Pride's writers or editors.

335,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/14/21564999/college-football-week-11-chiefs-prospect-watch-a-november-mock-draft,College football Week 11 Chiefs‚Äô prospect watch: a November mock draft,"FILED UNDER:Let‚Äôs talk about who Kansas City might target in the draft based upon its needs as we see them right now.In my opinion, the bye week signals that it‚Äôs time to start looking at the upcoming NFL Draft in a more serious manner.The Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô week off provides time to reflect and evaluate what the team has done. While I enjoy just discussing college football as much as anyone, I‚Äôm much more invested in the NFL Draft and how players transition from college to the NFL. For that reason, I want to occasionally use this weekly post to get some mock drafts posted, giving some sample ideas of where I think the Chiefs‚Äô needs lie ‚Äî and who has been showing out during the season and could be on their radar.So let‚Äôs get down to the November Mock Draft and see how we can better set the Chiefs up for a three-peat in 2021.The general strategy for this draft was a balancing act: filling needs while adding high- ceiling players.Looking at the 2021 Chiefs‚Äô depth chart, the obvious holes that need instant starters are defensive end and the interior offensive line. The Chiefs also have questionable starters to depth at wide receiver, linebacker and potentially offensive tackle. As this draft went on, I tried to keep in mind that some positions need individuals ready to play immediately ‚Äî but at the same time, I still did not want to ignore top-end talent.2021 Draft: Jayson Oweh EDGE

+ Frame for additional weight
++ Explosive 1st step
+ Reactive athlete
+ Ankle flexion when turning corner
+ Club + rip into a skip turn on corner
+ Shoulder dip

- Limited play time
- Pass rusher only in 19
- Hand usage/move variety and timing pic.twitter.com/OdwLGg4VxOComing into the season, Jayson Oweh was a raw pass-rush specialist who showed incredible potential but was still putting all of the pieces together. When the Big Ten announced the season was cancelled, it became unlikely he could come out based upon his previous usage ‚Äî but now that the conference has returned, so has Oweh.Oweh‚Äôs explosive traits and speed are outrageous given his size ‚Äî listed at 6 feet 5, 252 punds. He wins with the first step and his ability to dip his shoulder or put his foot in the ground and bend ‚Äúunder the table‚Äù and get below a blocker‚Äôs hands. The speed, the flexibility and ever-improving hands showcase a prospect who has top-10 type traits that is still working to tie everything together.Up until this season, he was often used only as a pass-rush specialist but is finally on the field full time. His ability as a run defender is still questionable, but he‚Äôs shown vast improvement in his strength at the point of attack and his hand technique. That functionality as a base end combined with a progressing counter-rush plan give him three-down potential.Tylan Wallace WR #2

++ Ball skills/High point ability
+ Attacks space vs zone & w/ ball
+ Good speed, great quickness
++ Fluid hips on hard breaks & double moves
+ Physicality blocking & mid-route

- Limited route tree & xp vs press

Senior Bowl Top 250 pic.twitter.com/VQeHLhL6KETylan Wallace is an interesting prospect because he plays much bigger than his size and his athletic skill set appears to align with slightly different usage than he sees at Oklahoma State. Wallace is listed at 6 feet and 190 pounds (though he is likely a little smaller than that), yet he is often asked to be the red zone and contested-catch threat for Oklahoma State.He‚Äôs exceptional attacking the football in the air and battling through contact at the catch point ‚Äî but his real value lies in his quickness and explosion. In the spread offense he‚Äôs currently in, his route tree is limited ‚Äî but the potential to transition into a high-end route-runner is very evident with the aforementioned bonus ball skills.Wallace reminds me quite a bit of Jeremy Maclin, a player who developed into quite the possession wide receiver for Andy Reid ‚Äî despite not having elite size.Brady Christensen has been one of the cogs to the Zach Wilson hype machine, protecting the blind side for the young quarterback. Playing left tackle for BYU, Christensen immediately pops ‚Äî thanks to his nimble feet and exceptional mobility. He has a natural kick-slide and mirrors rushers with ease, utilizing his length and foot speed to control them up the arc.He has fantastic range as a run blocker and works his reach-block angles incredibly well on zone runs. For me, Christensen does profile a little better as a tackle, but zone-heavy teams don‚Äôt often have an issue trying a guy like him on the inside (see Ezra Cleveland with the Minnesota Vikings). The issue for Christensen on the inside is a lack of top-end power ‚Äî along with worry that powerful, squatty defenders will get into his pads ‚Äî but he‚Äôs shown an improvement in core strength this year at BYU.Love seeing Ambry Thomas get the call to come to Mobile. Long boundary CB with terrific ball skills (7 PBU and 3 INT in 2019).

Comfortable squeezing the boundary against a bigger WR on this play. Head around early in the route, extends arm to create space to high point the ball. pic.twitter.com/VH6cNgl28bWith Bashaud Breeland set to hit free agency ‚Äî again ‚Äî and the struggles of Charvarius Ward, the Chiefs could very well be looking to add a running mate across from L‚ÄôJarius Sneed next year. Rashad Fenton has proven he‚Äôs a quality depth player, but I‚Äôm not sure they feel confident in him starting full-time. That is why looking at a guy like Ambry Thomas in the middle rounds could prove useful.Thomas is only listed at 6 feet, 182 pounds, but he has good length and knows how to use his length to squeeze the sideline. His press technique continues to improve and his ability to match out of a press technique is high quality. There are times a lack of play strength does come into play, but Thomas makes up for it with fantastic ball skills. Thomas opted out of the 2020 season, so at this stage, his draft stock is a little more difficult to predict.Despite losing players like Joe Bachie and Kenny Willekes on their defense, we'll all be circling the name Antjuan Simmons from Michigan State this fall. pic.twitter.com/G3zAlPp6zxAntjuan Simmons is an undersized linebacker that may be built a little more like a safety, and he is making all the plays for Michigan State.In years past, he‚Äôs been utilized slightly more as an overhang or apex defender ‚Äî but this year, he‚Äôs kicked inside to the box and looks just as good. He‚Äôs quick, fast and knows how to make plays in the passing game ‚Äî all the things the Chiefs lack at linebacker.Simmons is listed at 6 feet, 225 pounds ‚Äî which will hurt his draft stock for certain ‚Äî but for the Chiefs‚Äô purposes, it may not matter. Currently, Dorian O‚ÄôDaniel looks like he‚Äôs going nowhere ‚Äî and Ben Niemann plays significant reps in passing situations for the Chiefs. Replacing these two guys with Simmons ‚Äî who combines the athleticism of O‚ÄôDaniel and the game processing of Niemann ‚Äî could be massively beneficial.Based on his play so far this season, if Simmons could add another 10 pounds or so, he may have the ability to transition into a three-down linebacker.Trey Hill is a big-bodied, powerful interior offensive lineman for Georgia who has played guard but is currently playing center for the Bulldogs. Hill checks in at 6-feet-5, 330 pounds and utilizes all of that size to drive defenders off the line of scrimmage. He‚Äôs incredibly powerful and can handle the strongest defensive tackles when asked to block them one-on-one.Hill takes quality angles to the second level, which allows him to make up for average athleticism and quickness. He does have to work on being more consistent getting off of combo blocks when defenders alter his climbing path; he doesn‚Äôt have the lateral agility to quickly adjust on the fly.Even though he doesn‚Äôt have an incredibly high ceiling, Hill ‚Äî like ex-teammate Solomon Kindley ‚Äî has the technique to step in and play early on.Have a day Tariq Thompson! pic.twitter.com/0lOz7vwo0wTariq Thompson has mostly played safety for San Diego State, but given its 3-3-5 defense and that structure, he has spent plenty of time in man coverage ‚Äî as well as playing deep.In 2020, he‚Äôs mostly playing as the centerfield safety, showcasing his range and ball skills on the back end. He is not the most physical player on the back end ‚Äî nor the most explosive ‚Äî so his draft stock won‚Äôt be overwhelmingly high, but the production and instincts are irreplaceable.Thompson has the potential to play as the Chiefs‚Äô fourth safety or second slot defender ‚Äî a role that they still haven‚Äôt filled since losing Kendall Fuller.Chris Rumph II was a popular pass-rush prospect entering the season, but his lack of size shows up too often. His explosive traits and ability to play in space will always make him an intriguing player, but here‚Äôs the question: where does he play in the NFL?At this point, Rumph may not have the size or strength to play as a 3-4 EDGE and be forced into transitioning to off-ball. Still, he could be intriguing for the Chiefs, as both Spagnuolo and Brendan Daly have utilized off-ball linebackers with that kind of rush potential.With Damien Wilson set to hit free agency, the Chiefs have to be ready to move Willie Gay Jr. to the WILL, which may mean a replacement needed at SAM. Rumph could be an option."

If Veach really wanted linebacker Patrick Queen last year, he might have been able to move up with one of those additional premium picks to acquire him and still have two additional premium assets.Veach could also hold onto his picks and load up with four picks in the top 102. He‚Äôs had a lot of success on day two of the draft the past two years, so having another swing in that range is not a bad thing.The newly approved rule of rewarding teams who develop coaches & executives of color could come into play twice over for the Chiefs.

Since late October, the seven-day average of new cases has remained above the second wave‚Äôs mid-July peak. On Monday, Kansas City, Missouri mayor Quenton Lucas announced new COVID-19 restrictions similar to those in place last spring. Both Jackson and Wyandotte counties have also announced new restrictions.Still, according to Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, the team intends to host a limited number of fans for the season‚Äôs final three home games ‚Äî at least for now.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been no discussion about changing the plans for the last three games of the season,‚Äù Hunt told reporters on Wednesday. ‚ÄúObviously, everybody in Kansas City is concerned with the spike in cases. We have a conversation with the health director ‚Äî Dr. Rex Archer ‚Äî on a weekly basis just to review what‚Äôs happened at our most recent games and what we can do to maybe improve the protocols on a go-forward basis.‚ÄùOne of only five NFL teams to begin the season with fans in attendance for their home games, the Chiefs have been careful, limiting fans to just 22% of Arrowhead Stadium‚Äôs capacity and requiring fans to wear masks while sitting among ‚Äúpods‚Äù of people they know.Hunt said that making it possible to host fans during the pandemic was important to the team ‚Äî and at least for the Chiefs, the decision wasn‚Äôt all about the money.‚ÄúFinancially, it‚Äôs obviously better than having an empty stadium,‚Äù he explained, ‚Äúbut at the end of the day, it‚Äôs not a huge amount of money. I think really the bigger value is for the organization ‚Äî for the team and the players. I think in having some fans in the stadium ‚Äì and our fans as I‚Äôve mentioned have done a great job of being as loud as they possibly can ‚Äì makes it feel as normal as possible. It makes the players feel like we still have a homefield advantage.‚ÄùAnd Hunt said that the Chiefs are also thinking about next season.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some value in having fans this year as we look to next year because, unfortunately, I think COVID‚Äôs going to be with us for a while.‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúBut the fact that we were able to have some fans this year ‚Äî maybe we can build on that next year once we get to the season.‚ÄùSo for now, the Chiefs will continue to have fans at Arrowhead.‚ÄúRight now, our expectation is that we‚Äôll have the same level of fans at those three games,‚Äù said Hunt, ‚Äúbut obviously with COVID, things are very dynamic.‚Äù"

In his 22-year coaching career, Reid is 24-5 following a week off (we included postseason weeks off in our tabulation). That‚Äôs 83%.Three of Reid‚Äôs five post-bye losses actually occurred with the Chiefs ‚Äî but his record here is still 8-3 (73%).Let‚Äôs remember all of Reid‚Äôs post-bye games since he arrived in Kansas City:2013: Broncos 27, Chiefs 17The previously-undefeated (9-0) Chiefs were handed their first loss of the season, as Peyton Manning threw for more than 300 yards and a touchdown ‚Äî and Montee Ball ran for two scores. This was the fourth of seven straight Broncos wins against the Chiefs.2014: Chiefs 23, Chargers 20Cairo Santos hit a 48-yarder ‚Äî leaving 21 seconds on the clock ‚Äî and safety Kurt Coleman picked off Philip Rivers to seal the game. The Chiefs improved to 3-3 and the Chargers dropped to 5-2 as the Chiefs snapped their five-game winning streak.2015: Chiefs 29, Broncos 13This was the game in which Peyton Manning broke the career passing yards record ‚Äî and also threw four interceptions, forcing the Broncos to put Brock Osweiler in the game. Charcandrick West was the Chiefs‚Äô rushing leader with 92 yards and a touchdown. By the way... the Broncos haven‚Äôt beaten the Chiefs ever since then.2016: Chiefs 26, Raiders 10Spencer Ware ran for 131 yards and a touchdown, but the star of the game was Dontari Poe, who scored on Hungry Pig Right. The play went into the record books as a rush ‚Äî but it looked more like a screen pass from Alex Smith.2016: Steelers 18. Chiefs 16This was a postseason slugfest where neither team scored a touchdown until Spencer Ware ran for a 1-yard score with just 2:47 remaining. The Chiefs went for two to force a tie, converting with a Smith pass to Demetrius Harris. But Eric Fisher was called for holding on the play. On the retry, Smith‚Äôs pass to Jeremy Maclin fell incomplete.2017: New York Giants 12, Chiefs 9 (OT)In one of the ugliest football games of all time, the 1-8 Giants defeated a 6-3 Chiefs team. Travis Kelce threw an interception. It was the second of four consecutive losses that eventually led to reports that Andy Reid had given play-calling duties to Matt Nagy. More recent take: the Giants‚Äô defense that kept the Chiefs out of the end zone was led by current Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.2018: Chiefs 40, Raiders 33This was the Chiefs‚Äô first game after releasing running back Kareem Hunt. Patrick Mahomes threw for 295 yards and four touchdowns ‚Äî and without Hunt, was also the team‚Äôs leading rusher. Mahomes had nine carries for 52 yards.2018: Chiefs 27, Colts 13As the snow fell at Arrowhead Stadium, the Chiefs ran out to a 24-7 halftime lead without a single touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes. Damien Williams ran for 129 yards and a touchdown. Mahomes and Darrel Williams each had one, too. Even Tyreek Hill got in the act, scoring on a 36-yard run as the Chiefs cruised to their first home playoff win since 1993.2019: Chiefs 40, Raiders 9This rout began when Tyrann Mathieu intercepted Deerk Carr on the Raiders‚Äô opening drive, setting up the Chiefs‚Äô first touchdown. Juan Thornhill had a 46-yard pick-six. Another Chiefs touchdown came after the Raiders couldn‚Äôt convert a fourth-and-1 at the Chiefs‚Äô 40-yard line. And all of that was just in the first half. Trailing 38-3, The Raiders finally scored a touchdown with 39 seconds remaining ‚Äî but Tanoh Kpassagnon blocked the extra point, which Charvarius Ward returned for a two-point defensive score.2019: Chiefs 51, Texans 31For 19 minutes and six seconds, it looked like the bye week magic was wearing off. The Texans had run up a 24-0 lead on blown coverages and special-teams miscues. But then Mecole Hardman returned a kickoff 58 yards. Daniel Sorensen sniffed out a fake punt, giving the Chiefs the ball at the Texans‚Äô 33-yard line ‚Äî and then forced (and recovered) a fumble on a Texans kickoff return. The rest was all Patrick Mahomes. After going 4-10 to start the game, he was nearly perfect the rest of the way ‚Äî completing 19 of 25 for 277 yards and five touchdowns for a passer rating of 151.2, leading a 51-7 scoring run that advanced the Chiefs to the AFC championship.2019: Chiefs 31, 49ers 21This was another game where Reid‚Äôs post-bye magic appeared to be wearing thin. In Super Bowl LIV, the team faced a 20-10 deficit after three quarters; the San Francisco defense had done an excellent job of limiting the effectiveness of the Kansas City offense. But halfway through the fourth quarter, the game turned when Mahomes asked, ‚ÄúIs there time to run Wasp?‚Äù The now-famous 2-3 Jet Chip Wasp converted a third-and-15 with a 44-yard pass to Tyreek Hill. The play sparked a 21-0 scoring run in just 6:35 of playing time, handing the Chiefs their first championship in 50 years.2020: Chiefs ??, Raiders ??The Chiefs take their 8-1 record to Las Vegas to face the 6-3 Raiders. The Chiefs need the win to grasp firm control of the AFC West race and stay in the hunt for 2020‚Äôs single postseason bye. And yeah... remind the Raiders that there is a price to be paid for taking a victory lap around Arrowhead Stadium."

The NFL conducted another combine here that we had and he had come to that. Spent a lot of time with him. You may not see him this year, but we‚Äôre going to take our time with his rehab, we‚Äôre not going to rush him, and he could be a guy that could really develop and be a player in the future.‚ÄùOld Dominion EDGE Tim Ward (6'6"", 255 pounds) got a Top-30 visit from the Chiefs.

Mahomes will win MVP and Chase Young will be Defensive Rookie of the Year. Offensive Player of the Year should also be Mahomes seeing that he plays offense, but will go to Dalvin Cook as it evolves into an award that excludes quarterbacks (which is good since there will never be another non-quarterback MVP). Offensive Rookie of the Year will eventually go to Joe Burrow due to his inferior supporting cast (though Justin Herbert‚Äôs group really isn‚Äôt that much better). T.J.

The Steelers‚Äô running game continues to be a cause for concern for Pittsburgh fans, as the Steelers rushed for less than 50 yards for a third straight game. The Steelers‚Äô defense minimized Joe Burrow‚Äôs success downfield, as Burrow was often forced to check down and settle for short completions.

When that position is also one where the team is notably thin, it‚Äôs massive. For this Chiefs team to become a dynasty, it will need great value at some positions where they aren‚Äôt able to invest significant assets. From what we‚Äôve seen so far of Sneed, assuming he returns to the field after the bye and keeps on his current trajectory, he has the best value on the entire roster.Tershawn Wharton: A close second when it comes to relative value is undrafted free agent-turned-defensive line stud, Turk Wharton. Wharton is showing an explosive first step when rushing the passer and grown-man strength when playing the run. Coming from a small school and stepping right into a difficult position is a remarkable feat. The Chiefs clearly got a steal in Wharton."

In fact, the only publication where the Chiefs moved in the rankings was Sports Illustrated‚Äôs MMQB, which made a one-week return to its traditional writer poll format in Week 10. For Week 11, MMQB writer Albert Breer had a different idea. Until the Pittsburgh Steelers lose a game, there‚Äôs not likely going to be more room for Kansas City at the top.Here‚Äôs our weekly sampling:(unchanged from 1)Three games in, and it doesn‚Äôt appear that Le‚ÄôVeon Bell is a thing in the Chiefs offense. Rookie running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire has seen his snap count drop in the past weeks corresponding with Bell‚Äôs arrival, but that doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. Blowouts in two games led to CEH getting a breather, and it was Darrel Williams who ate into the rookie‚Äôs playing time in Week 9‚Äôs 33-31 victory over the Panthers. Curiously, Edwards-Helaire played only 40 percent of the offensive snaps in that win, which makes you wonder what this backfield will look like when Kansas City returns from its bye. But don‚Äôt assume Bell carves out a significant role ‚Äî he‚Äôs looked a step slow in his limited work, like the same guy who struggled with the Jets.‚Äî Dan Hanzus(unchanged from 2)What would they take back: Not handling the Raiders‚Äô passing game in Week 5Between an ineffective pass rush and unfavorable matchups against wide receivers down the field, the Chiefs didn‚Äôt have much of a defensive game plan against the Raiders when the teams played in October. The results were four Las Vegas pass plays of at least 40 yards, 40 Raiders points and the only Chiefs loss of the season. The Chiefs will demonstrate how well they learned their lessons on Sunday, when the teams get together again, this time in Nevada.‚Äî Adam Teicher(down from 1)Last week: ByeNext week: at Las VegasThe Chiefs feel like they‚Äôre cruising along on the interstate at a steady 85 MPH. Last year, they found another gear late. If that happens this time around, with Patrick Mahomes closing in on some pretty historic stuff, look out.‚Äî Albert Breer(unchanged from 2)They come off their bye with a big division game against the Raiders. The best is yet to come from this team.‚Äî Pete Prisco(unchanged from 1)We‚Äôll hear about Kyler Murray‚Äôs MVP chances or why Alvin Kamara isn‚Äôt getting more MVP buzz, but it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre already giving some Michael Jordan treatment to Patrick Mahomes. Voters got bored giving Jordan the NBA MVP in the 1990s and started passing it around to others. The same could happen to Mahomes, who has become the clear MVP favorite this season. Over the next decade, there will be more seasons than not when Mahomes could be voted MVP. How many MVPs he wins will depend on whether voters get tired of giving it to him.‚Äî Frank Schawb(unchanged from 1)Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs needed that midseason bye to make things better around Mahomes. He‚Äôs been on fire passing, but they need to restore their strengths of running game and defense for the stretch run of defending their Super Bowl championship.‚Äî Vinnie Iyer(unchanged from 2)Eventful Monday included contract extensions for coach Andy Reid and GM Brett Veach before starting OTs Eric Fisher and Mitchell Schwartz went on reserve/COVID-19 list. Kansas City will surely need that duo back if it hopes for an eventful Sunday, when champs seek to avenge loss to Raiders in front of national TV audience.‚Äî Nate Davis(unchanged from 2)The Chiefs were busy Monday as they emerged from their bye week by announcing contact extensions for Coach Andy Reid and GM Brett Veach and placing offensive tackles Eric Fisher and Mitchell Schwartz on their covid-19 reserve list. The immediate post-bye schedule is interesting with consecutive road games at Las Vegas and Tampa Bay‚Äî Mark Maske(unchanged from 2)It feels like there are two legitimate championship caliber teams in the NFL right now. Those are the undefeated Pittsburgh Steelers and the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs. Behind them, things get a little messy. I really like the Green Bay Packers and Arizona Cardinals, but they have some questionable games out there. I still think they are really good, though. I would put the New Orleans Saints in that category, but with Drew Brees out for an unknown length of time with a collapsed lung... that team might be fading fast here in the coming weeks.‚Äî Tim Lynch(unchanged from 2)The Chiefs return from their bye to face a Las Vegas team that beat them earlier this season.‚Äî Brandon Lee Gowton"

While I enjoy just discussing college football as much as anyone, I‚Äôm much more invested in the NFL Draft and how players transition from college to the NFL. For that reason, I want to occasionally use this weekly post to get some mock drafts posted, giving some sample ideas of where I think the Chiefs‚Äô needs lie ‚Äî and who has been showing out during the season and could be on their radar.So let‚Äôs get down to the November Mock Draft and see how we can better set the Chiefs up for a three-peat in 2021.The general strategy for this draft was a balancing act: filling needs while adding high- ceiling players.Looking at the 2021 Chiefs‚Äô depth chart, the obvious holes that need instant starters are defensive end and the interior offensive line. The Chiefs also have questionable starters to depth at wide receiver, linebacker and potentially offensive tackle. As this draft went on, I tried to keep in mind that some positions need individuals ready to play immediately ‚Äî but at the same time, I still did not want to ignore top-end talent.2021 Draft: Jayson Oweh EDGE

+ Frame for additional weight
++ Explosive 1st step
+ Reactive athlete
+ Ankle flexion when turning corner
+ Club + rip into a skip turn on corner
+ Shoulder dip

- Limited play time
- Pass rusher only in 19
- Hand usage/move variety and timing pic.twitter.com/OdwLGg4VxOComing into the season, Jayson Oweh was a raw pass-rush specialist who showed incredible potential but was still putting all of the pieces together. When the Big Ten announced the season was cancelled, it became unlikely he could come out based upon his previous usage ‚Äî but now that the conference has returned, so has Oweh.Oweh‚Äôs explosive traits and speed are outrageous given his size ‚Äî listed at 6 feet 5, 252 punds. He wins with the first step and his ability to dip his shoulder or put his foot in the ground and bend ‚Äúunder the table‚Äù and get below a blocker‚Äôs hands. The speed, the flexibility and ever-improving hands showcase a prospect who has top-10 type traits that is still working to tie everything together.Up until this season, he was often used only as a pass-rush specialist but is finally on the field full time. His ability as a run defender is still questionable, but he‚Äôs shown vast improvement in his strength at the point of attack and his hand technique. That functionality as a base end combined with a progressing counter-rush plan give him three-down potential.Tylan Wallace WR #2

++ Ball skills/High point ability
+ Attacks space vs zone & w/ ball

Senior Bowl Top 250 pic.twitter.com/VQeHLhL6KETylan Wallace is an interesting prospect because he plays much bigger than his size and his athletic skill set appears to align with slightly different usage than he sees at Oklahoma State. Wallace is listed at 6 feet and 190 pounds (though he is likely a little smaller than that), yet he is often asked to be the red zone and contested-catch threat for Oklahoma State.He‚Äôs exceptional attacking the football in the air and battling through contact at the catch point ‚Äî but his real value lies in his quickness and explosion. In the spread offense he‚Äôs currently in, his route tree is limited ‚Äî but the potential to transition into a high-end route-runner is very evident with the aforementioned bonus ball skills.Wallace reminds me quite a bit of Jeremy Maclin, a player who developed into quite the possession wide receiver for Andy Reid ‚Äî despite not having elite size.Brady Christensen has been one of the cogs to the Zach Wilson hype machine, protecting the blind side for the young quarterback. Playing left tackle for BYU, Christensen immediately pops ‚Äî thanks to his nimble feet and exceptional mobility. He has a natural kick-slide and mirrors rushers with ease, utilizing his length and foot speed to control them up the arc.He has fantastic range as a run blocker and works his reach-block angles incredibly well on zone runs. For me, Christensen does profile a little better as a tackle, but zone-heavy teams don‚Äôt often have an issue trying a guy like him on the inside (see Ezra Cleveland with the Minnesota Vikings). The issue for Christensen on the inside is a lack of top-end power ‚Äî along with worry that powerful, squatty defenders will get into his pads ‚Äî but he‚Äôs shown an improvement in core strength this year at BYU.Love seeing Ambry Thomas get the call to come to Mobile. Long boundary CB with terrific ball skills (7 PBU and 3 INT in 2019).

Comfortable squeezing the boundary against a bigger WR on this play. Head around early in the route, extends arm to create space to high point the ball. pic.twitter.com/VH6cNgl28bWith Bashaud Breeland set to hit free agency ‚Äî again ‚Äî and the struggles of Charvarius Ward, the Chiefs could very well be looking to add a running mate across from L‚ÄôJarius Sneed next year. Rashad Fenton has proven he‚Äôs a quality depth player, but I‚Äôm not sure they feel confident in him starting full-time. That is why looking at a guy like Ambry Thomas in the middle rounds could prove useful.Thomas is only listed at 6 feet, 182 pounds, but he has good length and knows how to use his length to squeeze the sideline. His press technique continues to improve and his ability to match out of a press technique is high quality. There are times a lack of play strength does come into play, but Thomas makes up for it with fantastic ball skills. Thomas opted out of the 2020 season, so at this stage, his draft stock is a little more difficult to predict.Despite losing players like Joe Bachie and Kenny Willekes on their defense, we'll all be circling the name Antjuan Simmons from Michigan State this fall. pic.twitter.com/G3zAlPp6zxAntjuan Simmons is an undersized linebacker that may be built a little more like a safety, and he is making all the plays for Michigan State.In years past, he‚Äôs been utilized slightly more as an overhang or apex defender ‚Äî but this year, he‚Äôs kicked inside to the box and looks just as good. He‚Äôs quick, fast and knows how to make plays in the passing game ‚Äî all the things the Chiefs lack at linebacker.Simmons is listed at 6 feet, 225 pounds ‚Äî which will hurt his draft stock for certain ‚Äî but for the Chiefs‚Äô purposes, it may not matter. Currently, Dorian O‚ÄôDaniel looks like he‚Äôs going nowhere ‚Äî and Ben Niemann plays significant reps in passing situations for the Chiefs. Replacing these two guys with Simmons ‚Äî who combines the athleticism of O‚ÄôDaniel and the game processing of Niemann ‚Äî could be massively beneficial.Based on his play so far this season, if Simmons could add another 10 pounds or so, he may have the ability to transition into a three-down linebacker.Trey Hill is a big-bodied, powerful interior offensive lineman for Georgia who has played guard but is currently playing center for the Bulldogs. Hill checks in at 6-feet-5, 330 pounds and utilizes all of that size to drive defenders off the line of scrimmage. He‚Äôs incredibly powerful and can handle the strongest defensive tackles when asked to block them one-on-one.Hill takes quality angles to the second level, which allows him to make up for average athleticism and quickness. He does have to work on being more consistent getting off of combo blocks when defenders alter his climbing path; he doesn‚Äôt have the lateral agility to quickly adjust on the fly.Even though he doesn‚Äôt have an incredibly high ceiling, Hill ‚Äî like ex-teammate Solomon Kindley ‚Äî has the technique to step in and play early on.Tariq Thompson has mostly played safety for San Diego State, but given its 3-3-5 defense and that structure, he has spent plenty of time in man coverage ‚Äî as well as playing deep.In 2020, he‚Äôs mostly playing as the centerfield safety, showcasing his range and ball skills on the back end. He is not the most physical player on the back end ‚Äî nor the most explosive ‚Äî so his draft stock won‚Äôt be overwhelmingly high, but the production and instincts are irreplaceable.Thompson has the potential to play as the Chiefs‚Äô fourth safety or second slot defender ‚Äî a role that they still haven‚Äôt filled since losing Kendall Fuller.Chris Rumph II was a popular pass-rush prospect entering the season, but his lack of size shows up too often. His explosive traits and ability to play in space will always make him an intriguing player, but here‚Äôs the question: where does he play in the NFL?At this point, Rumph may not have the size or strength to play as a 3-4 EDGE and be forced into transitioning to off-ball. Still, he could be intriguing for the Chiefs, as both Spagnuolo and Brendan Daly have utilized off-ball linebackers with that kind of rush potential.With Damien Wilson set to hit free agency, the Chiefs have to be ready to move Willie Gay Jr. to the WILL, which may mean a replacement needed at SAM. Rumph could be an option."
359,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/14/21564981/what-we-learned-about-the-chiefs-in-week-10,,"FILED UNDER:Taking a look at the week of November 9 on Arrowhead Pride...Sunday‚Äôs coverage of the Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô 33-31 victory over the Carolina Panthers ‚Äî in which we saw a big milestone for quarterback Patrick Mahomes ‚Äî included Pete‚Äôs Sweeney‚Äôs rapid reaction about the team‚Äôs offensive consistency and the Arrowhead Pride Nerd Squad‚Äôs postgame analysis of a defense that struggled at every level. Matt Stagner tallied up four winners and four losers from the game, while John Dixon reflected on other things we learned.4. The offensive line remains a merry-go-roundThe Chiefs started Austin Reiter at center on Sunday, leaving veteran Daniel Kilgore on the bench after he had started three games. Mike Remmers ‚Äî who has been holding down right tackle while Mitchell Schwartz has been out ‚Äî was injured during the game (rookie Yasir Durant took his place) but was back on the field before the final gun. Meanwhile, Nick Allegretti and Andrew Wylie remained in their starting positions at left and right guard.Results seemed mixed. Mahomes appeared to have plenty of clean pockets in which he could operate ‚Äî but Chiefs rushers Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Le‚ÄôVeon Bell gained just 22 yards on just nine attempts.To be sure, part of this was a greater reliance on the passing game than we expected to see against the Panthers; the Chiefs were in the unaccustomed position of playing from behind until late into the third quarter ‚Äî and the passing game was working. As long as that‚Äôs the case, we can expect Andy Reid to continue leaning toward passing plays.On Monday, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and his quarterback talked about unusual play the Chiefs had used on Demarcus Robinson‚Äôs touchdown reception against the Panthers.‚ÄúThe last three weeks Pat‚Äôs been messing around with it,‚Äù said Reid said after the game. ‚ÄúSo I told him, I said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to put it in,‚Äô and he looked at me like I was crazy. But he had been doing it and it looked good, so, if I said, ‚ÄòIf it looks good, let‚Äôs try it,‚Äô and so we tried it. He goes down there during special teams and he was messing around with a couple things, so we put it in ‚Äî and it worked.‚ÄùAs has grown to be expected, Mahomes had more details to share about the play than his ever-humble head coach.‚ÄúYou see me in training camp and before practice, taking snaps with centers, and so obviously I‚Äôm doing formations and stuff like that and I started going in motion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAfter that, I had to go to Tom Melvin ‚Äî our tight ends coach ‚Äî and ask if it was legal for me to be in motion and he said as long as everyone was set.‚ÄùTuesday brought news that a full year after sustaining a knee injury, offensive lineman Martinas Rankin was back on the active roster.Rankin ‚Äî a former third-round draft pick originally acquired from the Houston Texans in August 2019 in a trade for running back Carlos Hyde ‚Äî started five games for the Chiefs in 2019. He sustained a knee injury in the Week 10 game against the Tennessee Titans and was placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.To make room for Rankin, the Chiefs waived former Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive end Demone Harris, who has been with the team since last November. He played in four 2019 games and has been active for just one contest this season.The Chiefs also placed practice-squad defensive tackle Braxton Hoyett on the Reserve/COVID list.Not every national writer agreed, but even the narrow victory against the Panthers kept the Chiefs at the top of multiple Week 10 rankings.NFL.com: 1(unchanged from 1)Patrick Mahomes is locked in, and it makes the Chiefs something close to unbeatable. A ball-control Panthers offense allowed Kansas City only 22 minutes of possession on Sunday, but that was still enough time for Mahomes to throw for 372 yards and four touchdowns in a 33-31 win. Mahomes needed just 40 games to reach 101 touchdown passes, passing Dan Marino as the fastest ever to triple-digit scores. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing the best of him right now,‚Äô‚Äô Andy Reid said after the game. Reid dialed up a pass-heavy attack against Carolina, and Mahomes relied on his two stars to carry the day ‚Äî Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce finished with a combined 272 receiving yards and two touchdowns. The defending champs hit their bye as the best team in football.‚Äî Dan HanzusFollowing news that the NFL had approved a plan to give a pair of third-round compensatory draft picks to teams that have a minority assistant coach become a head coach elsewhere, Wednesday‚Äôs Arrowhead Pride Laboratory podcast included a conversation about what might happen if offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy finally becomes a head coach.What will Veach do with the assets he has?A trade-up is always in play. Being good has a price, and the Chiefs are expecting to pick in the back of the draft in each round, as they have the last few years.One of those third-round picks could help the Chiefs move up five or six spots in the first round to ensure they get a player they are seeking. If Veach really wanted linebacker Patrick Queen last year, he might have been able to move up with one of those additional premium picks to acquire him and still have two additional premium assets.Veach could also hold onto his picks and load up with four picks in the top 102. He‚Äôs had a lot of success on day two of the draft the past two years, so having another swing in that range is not a bad thing.Wednesday also brought news that another Chiefs player was going to have to sit down because of the coronavirus pandemic.As a reminder, Hardman‚Äôs placement on the list does not necessarily mean that he has tested positive for COVID-19. The news came shortly after Yates‚Äô ESPN colleague, Adam Schefter, reported that the Chiefs asked the NFL to launch a COVID protocol-related inquiry with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA).1/2 Chiefs have asked the NFL to launch an inquiry with the NFLPA after a union rep conducted an in-person meeting with all KC players late last month and rep allegedly was unmasked while meeting and mingling with the players in close proximity, per source.Schefter later added that the NFLPA had been made aware of the situation and took action. It is unclear as of this writing if the two matters are related.On Thursday, John Dixon tallied up the records of the team‚Äôs remaining opponents ‚Äî and also took a non-traditional approach to determine how difficult the Chiefs‚Äô remaining schedule might be.The Chiefs drop from 19th-easiest to 29th-easiest. Once we‚Äôve applied the simplest possible method to adjust for the quality of upcoming opponents, a number of teams move around. The Chiefs, Chicago Bears, New Orleans Saints and Tampa Bay Buccaneers all have harder schedules that we first thought, while the Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers all have easier ones.But again... let‚Äôs not get too excited. The letter grades tell a somewhat different story. Using SRS, the Chiefs fall just outside that average range with a D+. The Buccaneers ‚Äî falling from 10th to 25th ‚Äî come closest to dropping a full letter grade.Then we learned that a player who‚Äôs been with the team for over a year might finally get a chance to play.Ward, 23, first joined the Chiefs as an undrafted free agent out of Old Dominion in 2019. The 6-foot-6, 255-pound defensive end red-shirted the championship season on the team‚Äôs reserve/non-football injury list.Ward did not make the Chiefs‚Äô initial 53-man roster in 2020 but was quickly added to the team‚Äôs practice squad. Ward could help fill the void left by Taco Charlton, who fractured his ankle in the Chiefs‚Äô 33-31 win over the Carolina Panthers and is expected to miss time.Ron Kopp Jr. had spent the bye week recapping the Chiefs players the Arrowhead Pride staff had voted to receive midseason awards ‚Äî beginning on Wednesday with special teams, most improved player and best assistant coach awards ‚Äî and then continuing on Thursday with our midseason picks for offensive and defensive rookies of the year. Ron saved the best for last on Friday:Team MVPQuarterback Patrick MahomesThe reigning Super Bowl MVP quarterback swept the votes for the team‚Äôs most valuable player.Mahomes has been as prolific as ever this year ‚Äî if not more. He‚Äôs second in the NFL in both passing yards and passing touchdowns, thrown an interception on the lowest percentage of his pass attempts ‚Äî and is in the top three in both passer rating and ESPN‚Äôs QBR metric.Mahomes has his blow up games ‚Äî like the 385 passing yards and five total touchdowns against the Baltimore Ravens or the 416 yards and five scores through the air on the New York Jets. Mahomes has also had not-as-flashy games ‚Äî like the 211 yards and three touchdowns against the Houston Texans in the season opener, which was a performance that his backup quarterbacks Matt Moore and Chad Henne called ‚Äúone of the best game he‚Äôs played.‚Äù"

377,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/5/5/21246410/understanding-the-nfls-new-roster-rules-beginning-in-2020,Understanding the NFL‚Äôs new roster rules beginning in 2020,"FILED UNDER:Confused by the new CBA‚Äôs roster rules? Here‚Äôs everything you need to know to be an expert.When the NFL and the NFL Players Association executed its new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) on March 15, the headline-grabbing provisions included a 17-game regular season (which won‚Äôt happen any sooner than the 2021 season) and an increase in the players‚Äô cut of league revenue ‚Äî the biggest part of which will also occur in 2021.But the new deal also changed some of the rules about team rosters and practice squads ‚Äî and those have generated a lot of confusion among fans.So let‚Äôs go through exactly how the rules have changed, how they have stayed the same ‚Äî and how the Kansas City Chiefs might use them.Team rosters are still limited to 53 players ‚Äî and during the season, the salary cap is still based on the contracts of those 53 players. As before, teams may have up 90 players on their roster through the offseason and training camp, but only the top 51 contracts count against the cap.The usual rules about practice-squad players still apply: in order to move one to the active roster, another player must be first be removed ‚Äî either by being placed on a reserve list (such as injured reserve) or being released outright. Once a practice squad player is on the roster, they can only return to the practice squad by first being waived ‚Äî which allows any other team to pick them up from the waiver wire. Once they have cleared waivers, they may be re-signed to a new practice-squad contract.Once elevated to the active roster, practice-squad players must be paid a weekly salary (based on 1/17 of their NFL minimum salary) for at least three weeks ‚Äî even if they are waived from the roster before then. And if a team chooses to poach a practice-squad player from another team, they must be carried on the new club‚Äôs 53-man roster for at least three weeks ‚Äî and be paid accordingly.Practice squad eligibilityAs you‚Äôve probably heard, the new CBA allows an expansion of team practice squads from 10 players to 12 in 2020. But eligibility rules have been substantially relaxed. Players who can be on practice squads now fall into four groups:If you think the third and fourth groups are a departure from the old rules, you‚Äôre right. It is.But both of them have a limitation: a team may only have four practice-squad players whose eligibility is based on Group 3 ‚Äî and only two based on Group 4. Starting in 2022 ‚Äî when the squad size increases to 14 players ‚Äî four Group 4 layers will be allowed.Wouldn‚Äôt this allow a class of professional practice-squad players to exist? In some respects, it would ‚Äî particularly if we‚Äôre talking about players who have been in the league for a number of years, but who aren‚Äôt quite good enough to be on a team‚Äôs roster.A team might want to have a couple of guys like that on their practice squad to provide veteran leadership and improve roster depth. In the case of the Chiefs, think of players like Anthony Sherman or Daniel Sorensen. If they become cap casualties (and can‚Äôt find a spot on another team) the Chiefs might consider putting them on their practice squad. Whether or not the Chiefs (or any other team) will choose to make such a move is unknown ‚Äî but the new rules would allow it.Practice squad payThe 2011 CBA only stated a minimum weekly salary for practice-squad players. Otherwise, teams could pay them whatever they wanted ‚Äî usually so that their players would be less likely to be poached. As recently as last season, the New England Patriots (of course it was the Patriots) reportedly paid a practice-squad player the minimum active roster salary to keep them from being poached. The only limitation on practice-squad salaries was that they counted against the salary cap ‚Äî and they still do.But the new CBA eliminates unlimited practice-squad salaries. All practice-squad players are paid a fixed weekly salary established under the CBA ‚Äî except for Group 4 players, for whom the CBA establishes a minimum and maximum salary. In 2020, both are $12,000 for Group 4; all other practice-squad players will be paid $8,400 per week. In 2022, the Group 4 salaries must be between $15,400 and $19,900, while all others will be paid $11,500.Practice squad elevationAs noted before, the normal rules about moving a player from the practice squad to the active roster remain in place. But the new CBA adds an alternative method called the Standard Elevation Addendum (SEA).In many news articles about the CBA, brief descriptions of the SEA have led to a misconception that NFL rosters were increasing to 55 players ‚Äî but this isn‚Äôt the case.The SEA has its roots in the 2011 CBA‚Äôs Contagious Disease Addendum (CDA). This provision allowed a team that had been granted a roster exemption because one of its players had been infected with a contagious disease to easily (and temporarily) elevate a practice-squad player for a game. The player would be paid 1/17 of the appropriate NFL minimum salary for the game ‚Äî and afterward, would automatically be returned to the practice squad. There was no requirement that they be paid as a regular player for three weeks ‚Äî or pass through the waiver system before returning.The new SEA does exactly the same thing ‚Äî except that no doctor‚Äôs note (a roster exemption) is required; teams may use it for any reason they wish. It may be used on as many as two practice-squad players per game.But both the SEA and the CDA (which remains in the 2020 deal) have a significant catch: they may not be applied to the same player for consecutive games. If a team wishes to make the practice-squad player available for the next game, the CBA requires that it ‚Äúmust follow all of the established procedures for signing a practice squad player to an NFL player contract‚Äù ‚Äî in other words, do it the old-fashioned way.There is one other wrinkle to the SEA ‚Äî one that is not shared by the older CDA: it may be used only twice per season on an individual player. Any other elevation of that player to the active roster must be done using the ‚Äúestablished procedures.‚ÄùWe don‚Äôt know how often teams will opt to use the SEA. But it‚Äôs not hard to imagine where it could be useful.Let‚Äôs say Chiefs cornerback Charvarius Ward is nursing a hamstring injury. He might be able to play on Sunday, but you think he‚Äôll be ready to play a week later. Using the SEA to make a practice-squad corner available to play in the coming game makes it easier to make a game-day decision that allows Ward to rest for another week.The game-day rosterUnder the 2011 CBA, teams were allowed to dress 46 players from their 53-man roster for a game. Under the new deal, they can dress 47. They can also dress a 48th player ‚Äî as long as the game-day roster includes at least eight offensive linemen. But as we‚Äôve seen, they can choose not just from their active roster, but also from designated practice-squad players ‚Äî up to two from applications of the SEA, and perhaps more from CDA designations.But why do offensive linemen get an extra roster spot?It is believed to be because of the way the modern game is being played. To keep them fresh, defensive linemen are routinely rotated in and out of the lineup. Offensive linemen, however, tend to be a static group of players who are on the field for every offensive snap. This has led to most teams making just seven offensive linemen active on game days ‚Äî meaning that after just two injuries on the offensive front, no one is available in the event of a third injury.Last season, the Chiefs had at least two offensive linemen inactive for every single game. In about half of the games, three were inactive ‚Äî and in one game, four didn‚Äôt dress. It‚Äôs a safe bet that the Chiefs will opt to dress a 48th player on game days."

Four week ago, the ‚ÄúLock of the Week‚Äù was so hot that I started looking at timeshares in St. Lucia, but now, I‚Äôve missed four straight weeks against the spread and I can‚Äôt even afford to buy things off the dollar menu at McDonald‚Äôs. Life comes at you fast.Due to all of this, I‚Äôve decided not to overthink the ‚ÄúLock‚Äù this week. I‚Äôm going with one of the pick that‚Äôs almost always a lock: Picking Andy Reid to win off the bye. Giving Andy Reid a bye week to prepare for a game is such an unfair advantage that the Chiefs really shouldn‚Äôt even get a bye as long as he‚Äôs their coach. In his 21-year career, Reid has gone 18-3 after the bye week and this includes last season, when the Chiefs absolutely destroyed the Raiders 40-9 off the bye.Grading every NFL team after 10 weeks | YardBarkerKansas City Chiefs: A-The reigning champs really can‚Äôt complain about a 8-1 start, even as their lone loss to the Raiders was severely disappointing.

Monday night‚Äôs group will include umpire Barry Anderson, down judge Julian Mapp, line judge Carl Johnson, side judge Dale Shaw, field judge Anthony Jeffries and back judge Greg Steed.Midseason check-in: five Chiefs in a contract yearSammy WatkinsAfter restructuring his contract for 2020, wide receiver Sammy Watkins had a lot of reason to put up big numbers this year. The new part of the deal was incentives for statistical season totals, up to $7 million in addition to his $5 million base salary.Through four games, Watkins was on pace for 76 catches, 792 receiving yards and four touchdowns. Those totals would not hit his incentive requirement, for what it‚Äôs worth. He did manage to score his second touchdown of the season in Week 5 before limping off the field with a hamstring injury. He was never placed on injured reserve but has not been active for a game since.The offense hasn‚Äôt experienced any noticeable drop-off in performance with Watkins out of the lineup. They also haven‚Äôt played any challenging defenses in that stretch. In the final seven games of the regular season, they will need all hands on deck offensively, so it will be significant to see when he returns after the bye week.If he comes back and plays like he did in the final games of the 2019 championship run, there‚Äôs every reason in the world to make another short-term, incentivized deal work."

Up until that point, Mahomes had completed 13 of 18 throws for 176 yards and three touchdowns in the second half alone. The Chiefs had failed to score on only two offensive possessions all day ‚Äî their last one in the first half, in which they simply ran out of time, and a missed field goal. They had yet to punt.The offense, in other words, was rolling. And that‚Äôs with very little contribution from the running game ‚Äî 12 carries, 30 yards. The passing plays kept the clock moving nearly two-thirds of time. The Chiefs averaged 8.3 yards per pass attempt. That keyed their success. It usually does. And if that‚Äôs the manner in which you built the lead, is it not the manner in which to secure it?Not usually. The Chiefs followed a plan Sunday that most other NFL teams would follow, too.

San Francisco tight end George Kittle rebroke that record hours later, but this year, Kelce is peerless. He has 168.9 fantasy points this season (almost a Gronk-like figure), while the next closest tight end is Darren Waller with 111.4. Kelce has more than twice as many PPR points than Evan Engram, the 10th-highest scoring tight end this season, and nearly 300 more receiving yards than any one at his position. Kelce‚Äôs absolute dominance is giving the people who drafted him the equivalent of an extra roster spot.2020 NFL Playoff Picture: Here are the projected postseason chances for all 32 teams heading into Week 10 | CBS Sports2.

After playing in a handful of snaps in his rookie season, the second-year, seventh-round selection was forced to step into the lineup in Week 6 due to injury. He hasn‚Äôt been out of the starting five since, and he has played noticeably well. His road-grading style is the closest any Chiefs lineman plays to injured left guard Kelechi Osemele, and he has been significant to the offense.Hitchens is also a very worthy award-winner. He‚Äôs taken a lot of heat from followers of the Chiefs for not producing up to the standard set by his contract ‚Äî but in his second year with defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, he looks more comfortable. He looks quicker to his assignments and puts himself in a better position to make a strong tackle than he has at times before. He‚Äôs always been the brain of the defense, but his improvements in reaction time and fundamentals have made him an even more invaluable part of the unit."

389,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/10/24/21532080/slow-playing-the-chiefs,,"Arrowhead Pride | Kansas City Chiefs Schedule, News, Roster and StatsBy CoachJA Ôòë @CoachJimAdam on Oct 24, 2020, 7:47pm CDT +2018 was a rough year for Kansas City Chiefs fans. And not just because of a coin flip in the AFC Championship game. The true dilemma was that a new quarterback, a stud running back, an all-pro tight end, and a kick-returner-turned-wide receiver were unleashed upon an unsuspecting league, and football was forever changed in Kansas City.We didn't know it was a problem. We thought it was great! Mahomes, Hunt, Kelce, and Hill, plus Watkins, Conley, Robinson, and all the rest destroyed defenses across the league. They dominated on offense.Here's a list of ALL the teams in LIV seasons that have averaged 35+ points per game:And that's it. That's the whole* list. Great seasons in those years by Manning, Brady, and Rodgers would not have seemed impossible to the pre-season NFL fan. But Patrick Mahomes' 2018 season was a bolt of lightning.We all thought he might have a few more touchdown passes than Alex Smith, but it was reasonable to assume he'd have a lower completion percentage, and certainly more interceptions. This was nearly a CONSENSUS view among football talking heads. Adam Teicher counting training camp interceptions comes to mind.We all know what happened instead - 5,097 yards, 50 TDs, NFL MVP. And the bar was set.(Humble brag - I remember telling my niece's husband in the pre-season that I thought the Chiefs offense would be 'historic' and remind people of the '99 Rams Greatest Show on Turf - a new QB and a record-setting offense. But even at my most optimistic I couldn't imagine Mahomes would do that.)Fast forward to today, and the regular season Chiefs haven't been a 35 ppg offense in even any four game stretch since. They averaged 28.19 ppg last year and 29.17 so far in '20. They pushed it up to 39 ppg in three games over the playoffs last year - what an amazing run - but the the playoffs are a little different, because it's win or go home, so opponents play defense more aggressively.This regular season strategy of Chiefs' opponents playing soft coverage, slowing down, using the clock, running the ball, and reducing possessions seems designed purely to keep the score close. Nearly every other team in the league just hopes to have a puncher's chance at the end of the game.That's going to be the natural reaction of any team that believes the Chiefs could score 35 against their preferred style of play. Unless they believe their team can score 36+ (Gruden!) teams HAVE to find a way to keep the Chiefs score down in the 20's.The risk they run of course is that slowing down the Chiefs also cuts down the number of possessions for their team. In the end, even if one or both teams slow down the pace of play, it all comes down to points per drive.The best place I've found to examine points per drive is here, on FootballOutsiders. The great thing these guys do is put corresponding defensive numbers alongside the offensive numbers, to get a 'net' points per drive - how many you score versus how many you give up, all per drive.Here's a list of the top ten teams in offensive points per drive in 2020. I added the number of offensive drives per game and rank, plus their Net Points Per Drive and that rank for those ten teams.The Chiefs are currently number 2 in the league, behind only Pittsburgh, in net points per drive. The Chiefs are four missed XP's and one td-instead-of-field-goal behind the Steelers. I have to believe that placement kicks will improve and that Bell should help in the red zone. If they stay healthy, the Chiefs absolutely should end the regular season number 1 in net points per drive.Among all the teams in 2020, the Chiefs are 30th in offensive drives per game. So slow-playing the Chiefs is a real thing. But when you play the Chiefs to 'keep-it-close' you will damage your own Drives Per Game. The Patriots and Bills rank 27th and 31st in offensive drives per game. (The Chargers have picked up the pace since playing the Chiefs - probably due to the acclimation of Justin Herbert as much as anything else.)Finally, EB was absolutely right in his press conference. W or L - those are really the stats that matter in pro football. And if you're a great team, you stop worrying about the pace of play, or the number of possessions. Whatever game they want to play, you'll play. You just keep working to raise that Offensive Points per Drive up toward 7, and the rest will take care of itself.Do you think Denver will keep playing fast? Currently the Broncos are ranked number 5 in the league in Offensive Drives per game. Or will they slow it down, play soft coverage, and grind the number of possessions downward in the snow? I've decided... I don't care.Enjoy the game all!*Footnote: Why no 35+ PPG teams prior to 2007, and then the Pats and three more teams in the last decade?

399,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/13/21560223/film-review-undrafted-free-agent-tershawn-wharton-is-taking-over,Film review: undrafted free agent Tershawn Wharton is taking over,"FILED UNDER:The Chiefs defensive tackle has gone from being an unknown UDFA to an important rotational player.Immediately following the NFL Draft, every team begins signing players who went undrafted. These players often struggle to simply be ‚Äúcamp bodies,‚Äù so it‚Äôs a win if they can stick on a team‚Äôs practice squad. It‚Äôs likely years before these players develop enough to make it onto a team‚Äôs active roster ‚Äî let alone make an impact on the field.But once in a while, an undrafted rookie defies the odds against them.One of those players is Kansas City Chiefs defensive lineman Tershawn Wharton, signed out of Missouri Science & Technology in Rolla, Missouri last spring.Wharton ‚Äî just 6-feet-1 and 280 pounds ‚Äî is on the small side. Without great length ‚Äî and displaying good-but-not-elite production against a lower level of competition at Rolla ‚Äî no team took him in the 2020 NFL Draft. But Wharton has demonstrated that once you are signed to an NFL team, none of that really matters any more.Even without a full offseason program, Wharton was able to achieve the near impossible, earning a spot in the Chiefs‚Äô defensive line rotation for the first game of the season. Injuries to other players (and Mike Pennel‚Äôs suspension) gave him opportunities for playing time ‚Äî but it‚Äôs what he‚Äôs done with that playing time that has been most impressive.In their Week 9 matchup against the Carolina Panthers, Wharton eclipsed 60% of the defensive snaps for the second time this season. Over the last three weeks, he‚Äôs clearly demonstrated that he‚Äôs become a mainstay of the defensive line.So let‚Äôs dive into Wharton‚Äôs film, and see what the Chiefs like so much about this undrafted free agent from Missouri S&T.Given the Chiefs‚Äô high-scoring offense, it makes sense for them to field the most dynamic pass rushers ‚Äî and that likely plays a role in Wharton‚Äôs snap count.Tershawn Wharton has shown great development and is starting to make waves as an interior pass rusher

Club-Rip move set up with the outside stutter step

- Club falls a bit short but removes the OG's arm
- Wharton's lateral agility & body control allow him to sift between blocks pic.twitter.com/XNoIOR4bs1Outside of Chris Jones, Wharton is easily the most dynamic and quick interior rusher on the team ‚Äî and that includes the defensive ends who often kick inside. Wharton‚Äôs lateral agility immediately jumps off the screen; he‚Äôs able to threaten with one shoulder and quickly work across the blocker‚Äôs face to the other.One area in which Wharton has shown improvement from college is his hand usage while rushing the passer. His preferred pass rush move is a club-rip setup from a hard outside lateral step. The power in his club ‚Äî and his quickness to reset the gap ‚Äî make it a useful move.Because of his lack of length, Wharton will need to continue to develop his hands to sustain this success. With shorter arms and less mass ‚Äî but superior quickness ‚Äî he must keep his chest clean as often as possible. As long as he is able to do so, his quickness and explosive ability is going to be a problem for offensive linemen.Even on this particular play, his club connects with the blocker‚Äôs arms rather than shoulder, while his rip is late to get under the cleared arm. It‚Äôs a quality rep for Wharton where he gets quick pressure ‚Äî but if he‚Äôs a little more technical with his hands, he could be a step faster to the quarterback and affect the pass even more.If Wharton can continue to developing his hands, perfecting his moves, he's gonna be a problem inside

The quickness combined w/ his body control give him an uncanny ability to slip through interior gaps instantly.

*Don't mind the slip, he just ran 30+ yards chasing a WR screen pic.twitter.com/fmDRkpOaMYAlong with his agility, Wharton has fantastic explosion off the line of scrimmage ‚Äî whether working straight forward or laterally.On this play, Wharton is going for the same club-rip move ‚Äî but it‚Äôs so fast that the offensive guard isn‚Äôt even be in position to get hit. The slip at the end is a result of chasing the previous play 30-plus yards. But otherwise, he displays fantastic body control ‚Äî something he does consistently.There are still areas where Wharton could improve ‚Äî starting with his pass-rush plan. Right now, his pass rush consists of shooting a gap and using his club-rip move while crossing the blocker‚Äôs face. He will need to be able to do more. His lack of height and length limits some of his options, but he should still be able to incorporate a speed-to-power bull rush relatively easily.Adding a bull rush could lead to instant success. It would pair perfectly with how he currently sets up blockers with his quickness ‚Äî and would ultimately lead to a higher success rate.The Club-Rip makes another appearance, would love to see some speed to power off the outside stutter step moving forward.

His compact frame and lower body expl could lend to a high end counter to his quickness pic.twitter.com/NgiskiOIDyOn this play, while Wharton‚Äôs quickness and club move get the offensive guard off balance and to the ground, his power and body control are easy to see; he works through the contact with ease.As it stands right now, Wharton is either winning directly off the snap or getting tied up and washed out of the pass rush; his developing hand technique ‚Äî and lack of length ‚Äî make it hard for him to disengage once a blocker has latched on. That may always be the case for him ‚Äî but if he can add that speed-to-power element to his game, it would go a long way ti improve his diversity as a pass rusher.With his lack of size and length, Wharton will always be at his best in sub-package situations or as a rotational interior pass rusher. For this reason, Wharton sees the vast majority of his snaps as a backup to Chris Jones and a sub-package rusher; he gets minimal reps against the run.Wharton's size is always going to have some disadvantages vs the run.Lack of elite mass & length make it hard to hold the PoA consistently; he'll need to continue to develop his hands to disengage

Despite the disadvantage, good job fitting hands & trying to reduce the gap pic.twitter.com/2OrBmLFG9BWharton‚Äôs lack of size and strength at the point of attack do make him a liability in the run game. He struggles to stand up against powerful blockers and anchor against drive blocks at the line of scrimmage; he has only a small area of effect around him. He does have quality leverage and power in his lower half ‚Äî and the desire to be a complete player ‚Äî but even when he does everything right, it‚Äôs not always effective. It requires perfect hand placement (and a slow-developing play) for Wharton to work his leverage so he can defeat a lot of blocks near the line of scrimmage.Two areas Wharton does win as a run defender are chasing from the back side of a wide zone run and working to erase blocking angles. There are reps in which Wharton‚Äôs quickness and elusiveness allows him to slip under (or across) blocks and impact the play before he can be overpowered. He still has to perfect his hand technique and become more consistent with it ‚Äî but the potential is there.Best reps from Wharton vs the run are as a backside 3T vs outside zone. The initial lateral explosion makes him difficult to reach. Add that to a great center of gravity and power, he's hard to pin if you get hands on him.

He IDs the OG well too, disrupting the climb if possible pic.twitter.com/0RKNOBTKcrWhen working on the back side of zone runs ‚Äî especially wide zone runs ‚Äî Wharton is incredibly difficult for a back side offensive tackle to reach. Here he does a good job, quickly identifying the run and working down the line of scrimmage. He often works to disrupt an offensive guard if they try to climb up to the second level ‚Äî and then gets laterally as quickly as possible.Even with his lack of length, he does a good job placing his hands on the front shoulder of a reaching offensive tackle, keeping them at bay with better leverage. As a run defender, that‚Äôs a specific strength ‚Äî but with as many NFL teams that currently specialize in wide zone, it‚Äôs helpful.Wharton started this season as just another undrafted free agent, but he‚Äôs quickly risen up the ranks to become one of the team‚Äôs key rotational players. There are physical limitations that will always hinder his upside ‚Äî or his ability to be a completely dominant defensive tackle ‚Äî but that doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt plenty of positive upside. Wharton has a unique set of traits that make him a mismatch for all but the most athletic NFL offensive linemen.If Wharton can continue to develop his hand technique and improve his pass rushing arsenal, he‚Äôll continue to be a significant contributor for the Chiefs in another run at a Super Bowl victory. But more importantly, if he can continue the development he‚Äôs shown in this shortened offseason, he‚Äôll become a key piece in the Chiefs‚Äô defense for the long haul."

It simply doesn‚Äôt matter, as no tight end has the ability to dominate a game like Kelce has these past two weeks for the Chiefs. In a struggling first half of football, it was Kelce who put the team on his back to help them keep the score close and move the ball down the field. Kelce may not have the athleticism in terms of speed and quickness he once had, but he‚Äôs aged so incredibly well in terms of his IQ and fluidity that he remains unguardable. Rarely are tight ends this deserving of praise, but it would be rather difficult to name five offensive skill players that have been better than Kelce this season.Wharton just getting better

That‚Äôs a QUICK rip from great leverage pic.twitter.com/WEXChbM69AThis was the come-back-to-Earth game for the Chiefs defense, especially the linebacker group. Led by Ben Niemann in this case, the linebacker group struggled with the Panthers weapons and desire to attack the second level outside the numbers and in the passing game. Outside of a few plays by Willie Gay negated by penalties, the linebacker group was on the receiving end of big plays all game long.The pass rush flashed at times thanks to Frank Clark, Chris Jones and even Tershawn Wharton, but there was zero consistency. Steve Spagnuolo had to resort to blitzing at a high clip despite facing a very quick passing attack and even then, the players struggled to land home. The Chiefs‚Äô pass defense had played well despite the pass-rushing woes, but it caught up to them this game, as the Panthers picked them apart. Chiefs fans should hope the bye week allows them to get everything together and come back strong for the game against the Las Vegas Raiders on November 22.Arrowhead Pride podcasts are available on Amazon Alexa, Apple, Google, Spotify and Stitcher.

But the Chiefs know that, and you‚Äôd expect them to be up for the matchups ‚Äî with A-plus game scripts ‚Äî as they were for Baltimore. One might consider the Raiders a potential roadblock, but I‚Äôll be stunned if the Chiefs let that happen again.Here are the biggest roadblocks to the Chiefs ending the regular season 15-1:A road game against Tom Brady and the new-look Buccaneers is the clear-cut toughest game remaining on the schedule. While the Bucs‚Äô offense is coming off a poor performance against the Giants, the skill position talent is undeniable around Brady. The group will potentially get a boost as well when Antonio Brown returns to the NFL this week. Rob Gronkowski is starting to shape into form ‚Äî things are looking positive moving forward. There is a lot to like about the defense ‚Äî highlighted by a deep and athletic back seven that should present a unique challenge for the Chiefs. On the road against a good football team is a good formula to lose. Then again, this team will be up for that challenge.It goes Tampa Bay ‚Äî sizeable gap ‚Äî and then the Saints in the roadblock rankings.Another road game presents a challenge late in the year against a quality team vying for an NFC West title. The Chiefs could play a big role in determining who wins that division ‚Äî if either the Saints or Buccaneers do beat the Chiefs, that will create a significant advantage. The Saints are well-coached and talented on both sides of the football. Drew Brees is certainly nearing the end of his career but has been able to move the football with success. Wide receiver Michael Thomas has missed significant time this season but should be back for the home stretch. Alvin Kamara continues to be the ultimate dual-threat in the run and pass game. The Saints are on a four-game win streak ‚Äî two of them went to overtime ‚Äî and all ended as one-score games. They‚Äôre figuring out how to win football games, but it hasn‚Äôt been easy or pretty. Don‚Äôt overlook New Orleans late in the year ‚Äî they could hand the Chiefs a loss.Arrowhead Pride podcasts are available on Amazon Alexa, Apple, Google, Spotify and Stitcher.

451,chiefs,https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2020/11/16/21570501/chiefs-put-three-offensive-players-on-covid-19-list,Chiefs put three offensive players on COVID-19 list,"FILED UNDER:Monday brought bad news for the team‚Äôs offensive line.According to Monday‚Äôs NFL transaction report, the Kansas City Chiefs have added three tackles to the teams Reserve/COVID list: starting left tackle Eric Fisher, nominal starting right tackle Mitchell Schwartz and just-activated tackle Martinas Rankin.Reminder: these three players being placed on the list does not necessarily mean that any have tested positive for the novel coronavirus; they can be placed there merely for coming into close contact with a person who has tested positive for the virus.According to reports, this appears to be the case for both Fisher and Schwartz.Same with Mitchell Schwartz on the other side for the #Chiefs. https://t.co/JurXivIcAwThese three players join wide receiver Mecole Hardman and practice squad defensive tackle Braxton Hoyett on the team‚Äôs COVID list; both went on the list last week. As far as we know, neither of them has tested positive. During Monday‚Äôs press briefing, head coach Andy Reid said only that Hardman was ‚Äúfeeling good.‚ÄùSchwartz has already missed three games with a back injury; veteran offensive lineman Mike Remmers has been playing in his place. Whether the Chiefs had intended him to play on Sunday night against the Las Vegas Raiders is unknown.Rankin was just activated to active roster last week, presumably fully recovered from the knee injury he suffered in last season‚Äôs Week 10 game against the Tennessee Titans.Provided that their own tests come back negative, it remains possible that any (or all) of these players could be active for Sunday‚Äôs Raiders game. We have seen circumstances where it appeared the Chiefs put players on the COVID list as a precaution but returned them to the roster when their tests were negative ‚Äîor perhaps when additional research indicated the players hadn‚Äôt been significantly exposed.But now that the Chiefs have five players on the list ‚Äî three of them on the offensive line ‚Äî it should be noted that last week, the team asked the NFL to launch a COVID protocol-related inquiry with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA).2/2 Concern is this is a violation of NFL-NFLPA protocols and the rep is not subject to same testing as players and personnel and regularly travels among clubs, per source. NFL and team believes this created unnecessary risk of exposure to players and staff. https://t.co/XG8b60qFUbSchefter later added that the NFLPA had been made aware of the situation and took action. We do not know if this matter is directly related to the five Chiefs players who are now on the team‚Äôs COVID list."

After receiving their first test, they will be required to self-isolate for three days before being tested again. If they test negative each time (the tests they‚Äôre receiving return results within 24 hours) they‚Äôll be allowed to enter the facility this Friday, July 31.After that, players (along with coaches and staff) will be tested every day. At the end of two weeks, if a team‚Äôs total infection rate is below 5%, testing will ramp back to once every two days ‚Äî and go back to every day if the infection rate rises above that 5% threshold. However, it is important to note that these protocols could change as the season progresses and more is learned about the transmission of the virus.After that, training camp will be up and running.Does all of this mean the Chiefs will make it through training camp and start the regular season on time? Unfortunately, no.Does it mean that once the season starts, the NFL will be able to get in their full schedule of games ‚Äî all the way through the postseason? No... it doesn‚Äôt mean that, either.But this is the best the league and the NFLPA could come up with to give their teams and players a fighting chance to do both of those things.‚ÄúEvery team is going to have positive tests and we know that,‚Äù said Chiefs vice president of sports medicine Rick Burkholder on Saturday. ‚ÄúWe are testing positive at 75,000 a day now. We know that. What we hope is we limit our positive tests and when we get a positive test, we act accordingly with the CDC to get those people isolated and get them healthy and safely back to work.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to feel normal for anyone in this building because it is not normal,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to adjust. I‚Äôll go back to the 2019 season because no team adjusted as well as the Kansas City Chiefs and we‚Äôre going to adjust again. We‚Äôre going to get positives and take care of those guys so that when it is safe to come back to work, they will.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre as safe as you can be here [at the Chiefs practice facility],‚Äù said head coach Andy Reid. ‚ÄúThe dedication and staying disciplined when you leave this facility will be important. When you‚Äôre here, this is a safe environment, so you have to continue that when you leave here. That ends up being important, and we have a plan for that, too ‚Äî that we‚Äôll talk to the players about. I feel good about myself, yes. I feel good about it.‚Äù"

I absolutely love the player - a Titan of a man who looks more like a Greek God than just about any other player in the league. He plays the position that absorbs the most punishment but doles it out on a weekly basis. He‚Äôs an absolute joy to watch. The word unicorn popped into my head last night not only because he stands alone in the modern NFL but he has that thick single braid that sticks out the back of his helmet.I hate that I gave up on him in fantasy exactly one year too early. I bought a lot of Derrick Henry stock from the start of his career, and while he‚Äôd show flashes, he never delivered on the lofty expectations I had for him during his first three seasons. Even in 2018 when he eclipsed 1,000 yards for the first time and dazzled us with one of the greatest runs of all time - a 99-yard masterpiece - his numbers were still somewhat pedestrian.I wrote this piece before his big breakout last year, wondering if he could be better with a new offensive coordinator. It turns out he can be. (Bonus, I embedded that 99-yard run in that article)Henry reminds me a bit of a power hitter in baseball, a guy who may not give you much else. He‚Äôs going to hit 50+ HRs but his batting average might be .220 and certainly don‚Äôt ask him to steal or play his position well. Henry isn‚Äôt going to give you much in the passing game, but he‚Äôs so talented as a runner that he‚Äôs a locked in 1st round pick in fantasy.He won his first rushing title last year and has a chance to claim his second this year. He was snubbed a 1st Team All Pro selection last year but with his dazzling playoff run last year and the Titans again sitting in good position for post-season play, I‚Äôd expect he will change that in 2020. His only competition for the rushing title this year is Dalvin Cook, who missed a game but sits only 88 yards behind Henry and will play Monday night against the Bears.Here‚Äôs the only thing I‚Äôm worried about with Henry in 2021: Arthur Smith is probably going to be a Head Coach somewhere else. Yes, it‚Äôs possible another coordinator can come in and replicate the formula, but any coordinator change worries me.Henry should continue to be a first round pick as long as he‚Äôs given the volume, but he‚Äôll never catch an Alvin Kamara or Christian McCaffrey for value because of what those two bring in the passing game, although I‚Äôd rather have him than Zeke Elliot.As running backs become less valuable to teams in the sense of contracts and draft capital, a true unicorn like Henry becomes that much more valuable in our fake game.

470,bears,https://www.windycitygridiron.com/2020/11/15/21553541/chicago-bears-akiem-hicks-and-khalil-mack-dynamic-duo,Akiem Hicks and Khalil Mack are the Bears‚Äô dynamic duo,"FILED UNDER:Chicago‚Äôs best tandems have always been on defense.When we think of great teammates in the NFL, we‚Äôre often drawn to the offensive side of the ball and to the great quarterback-receiver tandems that we‚Äôve seen through the years; Joe Montana to Jerry Rice, Peyton Manning to Marvin Harrison, and Tom Brady to Rob Gronkowski, just to name a few.But here in Chicago, we‚Äôve never had any type of offensive euphoria that would lead to cheering for a dynamic duo like this, as our best tandems have all been on the defensive side of things. Gary Fencik and Doug Plank, Richard Dent and Dan Hampton, Lance Briggs and Brian Urlacher, and more recently, Akiem Hicks and Khalil Mack.Hicks and Mack have only been teammates for two and a half years, but their games complement each other as the mammoth 350-pound Hicks can dominate a game from between the tackles, and the athletic and powerful Mack can terrorize an offense off the edges.Hicks has played stellar football since coming over as a free agent before the 2016 season, but he really only started to gain some national recognition after the Bears traded for Mack in 2018. That was the first, and so far the only time, Hicks has made a Pro Bowl team, but few interior defensive linemen can anchor against the run and rush the passer like Hicks can.Mack has flashed elite talent since being a first-round pick for the Oakland Raiders in 2014, and he made the Pro Bowl for five straight years (2015-2019) while being named first team All-Pro in 2015, 2016, and his first year as a Bear, 2018.During that magical 2018 season, Hicks and Mack combined for 102 tackles, 20 sacks, 20 tackles for loss, 34 quarterback hits, nine forced fumbles, two fumbles recoveries, nine passes defended, and an interception returned for a touchdown. Pro Football Reference (PFR) also gave them a combined 40 quarterback hurries.Last year injures sapped most of Hicks‚Äô season, but this year he and Mack are on pace to have another productive season. Add in the fact that they are doing it on a defense that is constantly playing with one hand tied behind their backs ‚Äî thanks to an inconsistent offense ‚Äî and their numbers look even more impressive.With Hicks only playing in five 2019 games, teams were able to send extra attention at Mack and his numbers suffered. He was still a dominant force off the edge for the Bears, but his 8.5 sacks were the lowest total since his rookie season. It became almost comical how often teams doubled, tripled, chipped, and slid protection his way.With Hicks back to his usual self this year, he and Mack are back to stuffing the stat sheets each week.This season Hicks has 35 tackles, 3.5 sacks, seven tackles for loss, 13 quarterback hits, a fumble recovery, and a pass defended.Mack has racked up 33 tackles, 6.5 sacks. eight tackles for loss, nine QB hits, two forced fumbles, a fumble recovery, and a pass defended.To add to the duo‚Äôs numbers, Pro Football Reference has each down for eight quarterback hurries this season so far.This was supposed to be the season where the Bears offense gave the team enough to allow them to get back to their 2018 aggressiveness, but through nine games that hasn‚Äôt materialized. The defense is still a top 10 DVOA unit, but until the team plays complementary football and each phase can carry its own weight, we may never get the true impact from Hick and Mack.The Bears are squandering the prime years from not only these two outstanding players, but from an outstanding defensive unit as well.The soon-to-be 31-year-old Hicks has played in 82% of the Bears defensive snaps this year, while the 29-year-old Mack has been in on 86%. These two are giving their all to the team and helping set the tone early each week, but asking a defense in this day and age to carry a team is impossible."

It was a sad image that neatly summed up the entire Bears experience after a fourth consecutive loss, this time a 19-13 setback against Minnesota. This latest defeat was especially frustrating, as Chicago got an especially strong performance out of its defense and more special teams mastery from Cordarrelle Patterson, but still couldn‚Äôt get a win because the offense is completely overmatched. The Bears managed just six points and 149 yards of total offense in Bill Lazor‚Äôs debut as play-caller. As for Foles, Matt Nagy said after the game that the quarterback suffered a leg or hip injury. Turning this offense over to Tyler Bray is the stuff of nightmares.The Bears are down 3 spots to 19 according to CBSSports.com.The offense is so limited - no matter who calls the plays. They can‚Äôt move the ball. Nick Foles isn‚Äôt the answer and now he‚Äôs hurt.Here‚Äôs how Athlon Sports has it.21. Chicago Bears - Last week: 18Nick Foles‚Äô injury may have solidified this slide and Matt Nagy‚Äôs coaching tenure in the Windy City.

Week 10 Result: Lost vs. Minnesota 19-13Just when things couldn‚Äôt get any worse for the reeling Chicago Bears, they did.It was bad enough that the Bears were about to lose their fourth straight game after starting 5-1. That Chicago managed just 149 yards of offense against a Minnesota defense no one is going to confuse with the Purple People Eaters is even worse. That Nick Foles missed Anthony Miller only minutes before on a long pass that could have won the game is worse still.But then Foles was slammed to the ground while attempting to release a pass and had to be carted off the field.The Bears head into their bye week as a .500 team that has been exposed in every way a team can be exposed. The defense is good, but it can‚Äôt do it all. The offense has been unbelievably bad, and it hasn‚Äôt really mattered who‚Äôs been under center.At least when the Bears get back after it, they won‚Äôt have to go to Lambeau to get embarrassed by a clearly superior Green Bay Packers team.Oh‚Ä¶wait.No movement from the Sporting News this week?16. Chicago Bears 5-5 (16)The Bears have traded 5-1 for a four-game losing streak and Nick Foles, now dealing with a scary injury, hasn‚Äôt really provided the true upgrade at QB from now a shelved Mitchell Trubisky. The offense became more one-dimensional and less complementary to the defense without David Montgomery.Here‚Äôs how the USA Today has it.20. Bears (16): Unfortunate to see QB Nick Foles go down Monday night ... while pondering ways a punchless offense might have actually just gotten irretrievably worse.Here‚Äôs how Yahoo Sports wrote it up.18. Chicago Bears (5-5, LW: 16)In the first 29 minutes of the second half, the Bears had 14 yards of offense and one first down. It was indescribably ugly. Nick Foles‚Äô injury looked bad and you feel for him, but from a football standpoint, Foles or any other quarterback the Bears turn to next isn‚Äôt going to be the answer.ESPN has a ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô do-over for the Bears,16.

Quinn has one sack in nine games. To make room for Quinn, the Bears released former first-round pick Leonard Floyd in the offseason. Floyd, who now plays for the Rams, recorded three sacks versus the Seahawks in Week 10, giving him seven sacks in nine games for Los Angeles.

Would we feel better about their playoff chances? Would we be disappointed at their draft positioning taking a hit?RELATED"

Now, he‚Äôs looking like the long-term savior of the Bengals‚Äô franchise, even if their team isn‚Äôt winning too many games this year.One of the most fun things about college football is seeing which under-the-radar players break out of near obscurity and become household names across the country. It happens every year, and the Bears have plucked some of those breakout stars and turned them into draft picks. While Mitchell Trubisky and Kevin White stand out as disappointing examples, other players like Kyle Fuller and Kyle Long both broke out in their final collegiate seasons and are turning and had turned out Pro Bowl seasons for the Bears.The 2020 season‚Äîdespite its unparalleled circumstances‚Äîis no different. There have been several players who have boosted their stock for the 2021 NFL Draft, but a handful of prospects have risen to the top and have made themselves a lot of money with how they‚Äôve improved this year.Here are eight draft prospects who have risen up draft boards the most since the start of the 2020 season.No player in the 2021 draft class has improved their stock more than Zach Wilson.BYU‚Äôs 8-0 start and their rise to No. 8 in the AP Top 25 poll has been one of the biggest talking points of the college football world. The red-hot play of Wilson and their offense has the Cougars in playoff contention, despite being an independent team. The junior quarterback is averaging roughly 314 yards per game and completing 75.0 percent of his passes with an incredible 21:2 touchdown-to-interception ratio. His 2,512 passing yards are second in the nation as of this writing. He is also tied for the most rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in the nation with eight, solidifying his dual-threat status.Wilson is a talented prospect who has a strong arm that can deliver accurate throws from nearly platform and any throwing angle. He throws with great accuracy and can stretch the field with great timing on his intermediate and deep balls. He has a quick release, and he brings above-average agility in moving around in the pocket and scrambling to pick up yardage. The BYU star also does a good job of scanning the field and finding the open man past his first read.Sure, he isn‚Äôt the biggest quarterback out there, and his footwork could still use some work, but in the grand scheme of things, Wilson checks most, if not all of the boxes a team could hope for at the quarterback position. After an injury-plagued 2019, his improved accuracy and arm strength has him not only in the first-round conversation, but it could see him go as high as the top five.Last year, Kyle Trask was a big-bodied quarterback who showed promise after taking the starting quarterback job from Feleipe Franks. Now, Trask is looking like much more than that.Florida is currently ranked fifth in the AP Top 25, and their explosive offense has been a big reason why. In the five games he has played, Trask is averaged 363 yards per game, has completed 68.7 of his passing attempts and has scored a whopping 22 passing touchdowns to just three interceptions. For reference, he threw 25 touchdowns in 10 starts in 2019. That‚Äôs a major step-up from a production standpoint.Trask is a well-built quarterback at 6-foot-5 and 239 pounds, and he complements that frame with toughness in the pocket. He has gotten better at staying calm under pressure in 2020, and he is able to maneuver the pocket with precise footwork while still being able to scan the field. He has a solid arm and does a very good job of hitting his targets in stride. Trask‚Äôs accuracy has exponentially improved since he first stepped onto the field as the Gators‚Äô starter, and his consistent growth is cause for optimism for his long-term prospects.A lack of great athleticism and good-but-not-great arm strength could prevent him from breaking into that upper echelon of quarterback prospects, but Trask is legit. He could go Round 1 when it‚Äôs all said and done.This list isn‚Äôt going to be all quarterbacks, I promise.Being the predecessor to Tua Tagovailoa means that one would have very big shoes to fill, but Mac Jones has done an incredible job of doing just that, and he has garnered strong Heisman buzz for his 2020 campaign. Through six games, the Crimson Tide are undefeated and atop the AP Top 25 rankings, and Jones has been a big reason why. He is averaging 366 passing yards per game with a 78.5 completion percentage with just two interceptions to 16 touchdowns. With 2,196 passing yards, he is fourth in the nation in passing yards.Jones is an accurate and poised thrower of the football who delivers as pretty of a deep ball as just about anyone in the class. He does a good job of leading his receivers open and his able to time his throws so he hits them in stride. He is a mechanically-sound passer and can read the field better than most collegiate quarterbacks. His poise in the pocket has improved since he saw the field after Tagovailoa got hurt in 2019, and his timing on the deep ball has also gotten a lot better.While not the biggest, most athletic or strong-armed quarterback, he is a polished player who has propelled himself into top-50 conversation and could potentially sneak into the first round.If you‚Äôre looking to draft an offensive tackle with physical tools and a high ceiling but don‚Äôt want to pay a high-end price for him, Christian Darrisaw could be your guy.Darrisaw is an athletic tackle prospect who has above-average lateral quickness and very nice agility for a 6-foot-5, 314-pound lineman. He accelerates quickly when climbing to the second level, and he has the footwork and temperance in pass protection needed to nullify the speed rush to the outside. While his athleticism was apparent on tape prior to 2020, it‚Äôs his improvements in his power game that has scouts buzzing. He packs a nice punch at the point of attack and has shown an improved nastiness in his game once engaged with defenders.Granted, Darrisaw could still improve a bit more before entering that top tier of offensive tackle prospects. His pad level is a bit too high and his base can be too wide once he gets locked up with an edge rusher. However, he has a high ceiling on the blind side, and his tools and improvement over time could see him rise into the second round.Last year, Terrace Marshall Jr. was LSU‚Äôs third-best wide receiver and, despite 13 touchdowns, was firmly in the shadows of teammates Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase and Justin Jefferson. With Chase having opted out and Jefferson now in the NFL, though, Marshall has made the most of his chance to shine.Through five games, Marshall has 540 yards and nine touchdowns on 31 receptions, firmly solidifying himself as the Tigers‚Äô best offensive playmaker in a down year for the defending champions. He has showcased very good physicality in contested-catch situations, using his 6-foot-3, 200-pound frame and his impressive ball skills to box out defenders and catch the ball away from his frame while locking out whoever is covering him. He has looked more explosive in 2020, showcasing improved fluidity across the middle of the field and accelerating better off the snap. He has also gotten better at reading soft spots in zone coverage and exploiting holes in defense‚Äôs schemes.Granted, Marshall can still be a bit more sharp in his cuts as a route runner and can sink his hips for sharper-breaking route concepts. What he has, though, is a very nice combination of length, physicality and fluidity that could realistically see him make his way into the back half of the first round if he keeps up his current level of production.In a class where there isn‚Äôt a clearcut EDGE2, Azeez Ojulari has made a strong case through the first six games of Georgia‚Äôs season.In 11 games in 2019, Ojulari had 5.5 sacks and five tackles for a loss. In six games in 2020, though, he‚Äôs already up to 4.5 sacks and 6.5 tackles for a loss. The redshirt sophomore has gotten off to a hot start to the season, and his athletic ability is a huge reason why. Ojulari fires off the ball with impressive quickness and has good closing speed as a tackler in space. He is an incredibly flexible pass-rusher who does a great job of getting low and turning the corner while taking sharp angles in pursuit and getting underneath opposing blockers. His lateral quickness and fluidity gives him upside in coverage situations, and he is able to stack and shed blocks to make tackles near the line of scrimmage in the run game.Is Ojulari a first-round pick? His diminutive stature and a lack of true power in his game could prevent him from getting drafted that high. As an athletic, Day 2 prospect with a high ceiling and versatility for any defensive scheme, though, he could be worth an investment.Jaycee Horn was certainly on the draft radar heading into 2020, but he was overshadowed by teammate and fellow cornerback Israel Mukuamu. Now, a strong argument could be made that Horn has not only passed up his teammate, but has firmly entered first-round territory.Horn got off to a hot start to the new year right away, but his big coming out party came in South Carolina‚Äôs fourth game, when he shadowed future NFL draft pick Seth Williams and finished the game with two interceptions and four pass breakups. He currently has six pass breakups through six games, and his physicality and 6-foot-1, 205-pound frame have been complemented by improved instincts. Horn does a good job of recognizing route concepts and knowing when to time his jump on a route and burst to make a play on the ball. He has shown willingness as a tackler, and, of course, his calling card as an aggressive press corner who can box out the 50-50 ball and jam receivers in press coverage will have him high in demand.Athletic limitations aren‚Äôt a major issue with Horn, but a lack of tremendous deep speed and lateral quickness could stunt his ceiling a little bit. He has just about everything else a team would want in a boundary corner, though, so he stands a strong chance of becoming a first-round pick.2020 served as Bubba Bolden‚Äôs first year as a starter at the collegiate level, and after a hot start to his redshirt junior campaign, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if it was his last, as the NFL could very well be in the near future for him.Bolden has 40 tackles, one interception, three pass deflections and three forced fumbles in seven games for the Hurricanes this season. That stat-line offers some insight to his game: he is a versatile defensive back. He consistently wraps up as a tackler and is physical at the point of contact, and he is also athletic and can cover up a nice chunk of the field in single-high or two-hells shells with his hip fluidity and straight-line speed. He does a good job of reading a quarterback‚Äôs progressions and jumping routes, too. Plus, he has tremendous length at 6-foot-3 and 200 pounds. Whether it be as a coverage safety up high or a safety in the box, Bolden is a well-rounded player who can just about do it all.What hurts Bolden‚Äôs stock the most isn‚Äôt as much his on-the-field play‚Äîthough he can be too aggressive in pursuit and takes rough angles from time to time‚Äîit‚Äôs his off-the-field history. He dislocated his ankle five games into the 2019 season, ending his season. He played on just 21 snaps for USC in 2017 before serving a 28-month suspension for underage drinking at an off-campus party. That particular suspension isn‚Äôt as much of a concern as his lack of playing time, which gives him a limited resum√©. Regardless, Bolden‚Äôs breakout 2020 season could see him leap into Day 2 discussions."

WCG‚Äôs staff picks for Monday night‚Äôs pivotal matchup.In a time of genuine crisis, it can be difficult to stay calm. Rationality is at a premium. Reflecting and, in turn, diagnosing your own problems with enough time to right the ship is sounds a lot easier than it actually is. But what happens when the same problems keep hitting you upside your jaw, outright numbing you to the idea you can ever hope to fix them?The Bears are in the middle of a three-game losing streak. None of the defeats at the hands of the Rams, Saints, and Titans inspired much of any optimism. The same usual problems of an offensive malaise, a defense holding on for dear life and letting go at the worst, most inopportune moments, and an utterly overwhelmed coaching staff reared their ugly heads again and again. Whatever obvious deficiencies the Bears have for the time being, not only have they not been fixed or remedied, they‚Äôve actually consistently regressed. They‚Äôve compounded on one another, getting worse over time for almost two seasons now.In other words, it‚Äôs business as usual on the Chicago lakefront.A recent fan and reader poll conducted on Windy City Gridiron is, to me, fascinating on its merits. 15 percent of you have said you are confident in the current direction of the Bears. What I wonder is why that lowly number doesn‚Äôt include almost everyone? No one said the poll question was of a positive winning connotation. It asked you whether you are confident in the direction of the team, and that path can be taken anywhere. The current direction of the Bears is obvious: They‚Äôre on a downhill slope, with no answers from anyone in a meaningful leadership role, and the same problems everyone who dares follow them has seen for decades. Everyone should be overflowing with confidence at the Bears‚Äô direction, because it‚Äôs familiar and it‚Äôs the same depressing movie playing on repeat.Mike Zimmer‚Äôs Vikings haven‚Äôt beaten the Bears since late 2017. Kirk Cousins hasn‚Äôt beaten the Bears since he was a member of the Washington Football Team. Remember that era? Here‚Äôs hoping both don‚Äôt come off this illustrious schneid on Monday night.

One of those spots could be used for suspended wide out Javon Wims after this Sunday, one for Whitehair once he‚Äôs activated, with the other likely going to a current practice squad player.RELATEDHere‚Äôs how the Vikings listed their injury report for today:Things will obviously change before Saturday‚Äôs final injury report and we‚Äôll bring that to you once it‚Äôs announced."
480,bears,https://www.windycitygridiron.com/2020/11/17/21572515/convince-me-pace-should-stay,Convince me Pace should stay,"Chicago Bears Schedule, News, Roster and Stats | Windy City GridironBy Cloud_9 on Nov 17, 2020, 8:05pm CST +I'm being serious here. I'm going to enumerate the various sins of Ryan Pace and yet, I'm open to hearing why he shouldn't be canned. (Working assumption if Pace is canned, Nagy et al will be canned too. Also I realize that whoever replaces Pace could be worse, but Pace is bad.)I want to hear where I am wrong. I want to be shown the error of my ways, but since ownership isn't changing, I feel the only slim hope for the near future is a new GM.

There is a TL;DR summation if you just wanna scroll down to the bottom and skip my babbling.Drafting:While there is much more to being a GM than just picking players, you sign off on the picks. It means you've picked your scouts, trust their input, watched the tape and made the pick. The draft is a crap shoot, even the best GMs make bad picks, but Pace's drafting at the top of the draft is probably the number one reason he needs to go.Round 1:Kevin White- Nothing more needs saidLeonard Floyd- Solid player, but didn't do what Bears drafted him to do. Let him walk. Now rushing the passer effectively with RamsMitch Trubisky- Pace said he had ""Brees-like accuracy."" I know MT10 was rated highly across the board, but that quote sticks with me as his accuracy is abysmal. Also the trade up makes it an even worse miss.Roquan F'ing Smith- EXCELLENT pick. When you take an ILB this high in the draft you'd better nail it and he did.*Two Firsts traded for Khalil Mack- Taking nothing away from Mack, when you do this, your team better be THAT ONE DUDE away from a SB as you are spending a LOT of draft capital. I'm not going to say it was a bad trade, I'm just saying the Bears spent a lot and its not gotten them any closer to a SB.Round 2:Eddie Goldman- Total hit. His sitting out the year hurt the Bears terribly. I realize you weren't going to replace his production completely, but I feel that it was completely inadequately addressed early in the season.Cody Whitehair- Solid. He's above average at G & C. Not a homerun, not terrible. I think if he could just be left at one position he'd be even better.Adam Shaheen- LOL I mean, what needs to be said here?James Daniels- Ok. He's battled some injuries and much like Whitehair keeps getting bounced between positions. Hoping for more from Daniels but I also feel that 39th overall is pretty high to draft a guy projected to be your Center unless he's a slam dunk.Anthony Miller- Frustrating. Traded up to get him and man, mental errors left and right. The talent is there, the execution is not. And they traded up to get him which is a problem.Cole Kmet- Too early to tell. Seems like he might be an alright TE. Also not sure if he was worth as high a pick as the Bears spent.Jaylon Johnson- Too early to tell, but seems like he could be a very solid CB. I have hope here.Round 3:Hroniss Grasu: Another LOL You draft a guy who ONLY projects at center in the NFL in the 3rd & then he gets hurt.Jonathon Bullard: I kept hoping. There were flashes that maybe he'll put it together. It's a miss, but I won't kill him on this as I view Bullard the kinda player you spend a 3rd on. A guy with potential. Didn't work out, but alright.David Montgomery: Jury's out, but he looks like a dude. I get he's playing behind an awful OL. He plays really really hard. It also looks like he's probably just a dude. He has to break so many tackles because he's not explosive or fast or shifty. I like the kid, but he looks like a rotational back.------And here's a big problem. Pace has been drafting for the Bears since 2015. They have 3, count them, 3, 3 round picks. He trades away draft capital like mad. And that's fine, but when you do, you'd better get good value back and I'd say he has not.Now, I'm not going through the rest of the rounds and he actually does have some solid hits in the later rounds. But here's the thing, while that's nice great, finding value in rounds 4-7 isn't going to make up for missing a lot in rounds 1-3 (or just you know, not drafting in round 3 because reasons.)Free Agency:Much like drafting FA is a crapshoot. Sure, you're signing players with NFL experience, but lots can happen that's out of the team's control. That said, you still signed the paper. Here's a look at a small sampling of Pace's FA signings. (Point out any big positive or negative ones I've missed as there's probably some both ways.)Laughably bad: Money was set on fireMike Glennon, Marcus Wheaton, Deon Sims, Antrel Rolle, Ray McDonald, Ted Ginn jr, Robert Quinn, Germain Ifedi, Mike Davis, Cody ParkeyNot Great: Didn't work out as planned for whatever reasonPernell McPhee, Trey Burton, Demetrius Harris, Eddie Royal, Marcus CooperAlright:Bobbie Massie, Taylor Gabriel*, Prince Amukamura, Buster Skrine**Good to excellent:Ha Ha Clinton Dix, Corradell Patterson, Kevin Pierre-Louis***, Akiem Hicks, Danny Trevathan****, Sam Acho, Allen Robinson, Cairos Santos*Bringing in a small WR when your QB can't throw accurately probably wasn't the smartest, but Gabriel played as expected.**Skrine was alright last year. This year he's getting picked on, but defensive playcalling is odd too sometimes.***Not that KLP was amazing or anything, but given Trevathan's early season struggles and his contract (???) be nice to have kept him****I love DT and it was a solid signing. The recent extension? Well, good for DT, but that brings me to my next point.Questionable Contracts:You can't control if a guy gets hurt after you paid him. You can't control if he loses ""the fire"" or whatever. But you gave the contract so it falls on you.Some of the more egregious ones:Robert Quinn: I realize there is an out after 2021 but it still leaves 9.3 million in dead cap. This signing reeks of desperation.Mike Glennon: You can find my posts being ok with this because I trusted Pace at the time. Sure, it could've been worse, but it was still setting $18 million on fire. (Like, look, I get 18 million for a QB is cheap, but they paid 18 million for him to suck so badly MT10 started his career early. This was a horrible signing.)Danny Trevathan: I love him, but giving a guy with his injury history, this contract at this point in his career? Dumb.Dion Sims: Pace gave him 12 million to be bad. Seriously, I didn't understand at the time and I still don't.Pernell McPhee: You give a guy who's been a rotational pass rusher because he has no knees a big deal to be your full time pass rusher. And then, he's hurt because he only played part time for reasons. GeniusJimmy Graham: Yes, its really only 9 million. But again this was predicated on the Bears needing a TE who is only useful in the red zone. They did, but they can't even find the red zone. He's also seemed less and less invested as the season has gone on which isn't great. I'm throwing it more in there to highlight how much money Pace has thrown at the TE position that just hasn't worked out for whatever reason.

Cody Parkey: To give a kicker the kind of money Parkey got he'd better be amazing. Parkey was not amazing. He was awful.Coaching Hires:John Fox: I still don't know if this was Pace's hire or if he was ""gifted"" Fox as a condition of getting the job. Either way, it was bad.Matt Nagy: This was 100% Pace's hire and its been a disaster. Part of it is the awful offensive roster Pace saddled Nagy with. The rest is Nagy appearing to have no clue how to tailor his ""scheme"" (whatever it might be) to the talent he actually has.A TL;DR summation.Pace has botched finding a NFL level QB. I'm not even talking a good one. I'm just saying an NFL level starting QB, he has yet to find one.Pace has botched his two coaching hiresPace has missed on many high level picks and spent lots of draft capital trading up.Pace in FA has been ""eh"" with some hits, some misses and some real headscratchers.Pace has tied up a lot of money in aging defensive players while his OL is a sieve.The sum total is that Pace's track record with the Bears simply isn't good enough for him to be allowed to draft the next Bears QB. He's not the worst GM, but he's not good enough and he's had time to mold this time in his image and things have not gotten better.This Fanpost was written by a Windy City Gridiron member, and does not necessarily reflect the ideas or opinions of its staff or community."

482,bears,https://www.windycitygridiron.com/2020/11/16/21569998/2021-nfl-draft-positional-tiers-v4-0,2021 NFL Draft: Positional Tiers v4.0,"Chicago Bears Schedule, News, Roster and Stats | Windy City GridironBy IOftenPanic on Nov 16, 2020, 12:30pm CST +Latest positional board. I'm usually a week or two behind on scouting and it's still very early, so expect quite a few changes in the days to come. The first two days are more ordered than day three which is more a dump of names. Any mistakes or glaring omissions? Let me know. Thanks.


SIGNAL CALLERSThe QB class has gotten a big boost with the play of Wilson, Trask and Jones. After Wilson has entered day one for me, and is in the top 10 for a lot of pundits. Trask and Jones are both now day two prospects and both have an outside chance of seeing their names called on day one next draft.Lawrence and Fields are still the cream of the crop and a tier above anyone else. There's a large drop-off after Trask and Jones, but intriguing names like Ridder, Strong and Newman dot the day three landscape.I'll be surprised if the Bears use a 1st round pick on a QB next off-season unless Pace has assurances he won't be fired for a bit. The Bears are looking more-and-more like a 9-7 or 8-8 team bound to miss the playoffs and I can't imagine any GM or coach on the hot seat will want to draft and start a 1st round pick unless we're talking Lawrence or Fields.WEAPONSNot too much has changed since my last update. Running back still looks weak, with only Etienne flirting with day one. A lot of question marks litter the day two receivers in this draft, but it looks to be a pretty deep class overall. Tight end still boasts three intriguing names at the top, then a pretty wide gap to the next group.The Bears probably won't look much at running backs, the offensive line shares most of the blame for Montgomery's inability to produce. Receiver will be interesting as Robinson has not been extended and frankly I don't like the Bears cap space and situation dictating any kind of long-term deal to a non-elite receiver. Tight end may get a look if Graham is let go, but another high pick on a tight end seems unlikely.PROTECTIONThe offensive line class is looking pretty solid and deep. Darrisaw, Eichenberg, Slater, Linderbaum, Jackson and Hill are all risers for me after getting to more of their tape. I only have one elite prospect in the group, Sewell, who will be long gone before the Bears select.With needs likely at both tackle spots and one guard spot, I imagine the Bears will be happy to draw from this group early. I'd love for a combo of Leatherwood and Slater, though that's wishful thinking. Two plug-and-play, experienced, productive starters who can play almost any spot on the line.FRONT SEVENThis defensive tackle class could be deep on day two and three, but right now I see no 1st round prospects. Some have sat out, some regressed, it's just been a mess. Edge rusher looks deep on day two, but I only see two potential starts right now in the fast-rising Paye and Rousseau. This linebacker class is looking solid as well, with JOK being one of the biggest risers this season. Parsons is the elite prospect of this group who can cover, tackle, play the run and rush the passer.The Bears could use depth everywhere in these groups. The run defense has struggled with Goldman sitting out, so a nose tackle like Jordan Davis would be appealing if he doesn't end up in the 1st. Quinn hasn't been what the Bears expected and a long-term solution could be had here in the 2nd. Trevathan's play has picked up as of late, but he has seen some struggles and is likely around only one more year. Getting a running mate for Smith would be a route to explore.SECONDARYThis corner class looks strong, but the Bears may only look or a nickel if they look for anything this off-season. Safety looks deep on day two, but a lot of question marks keep some names out of 1st round consideration for me. A strong safety may be on the Bears shopping list. I'd love to see a name like Nasirildeen drop as a long-term partner for Jackson.This Fanpost was written by a Windy City Gridiron member, and does not necessarily reflect the ideas or opinions of its staff or community."

The mission statement is to provide life changing and impactful experiences through the freedom of flight. To recognize the accomplishments and sacrifices of veterans of all eras and provide flights for unfamiliar and underprivileged youth as an introduction to aviation. Jimmy takes up veterans in his two recent United States Army aircraft restorations; a 1957 de Havilland Beaver and 1967 UH1 Iroquois ‚ÄúHuey‚Äù helicopter. The Huey served as a part of the 170th Assault Helicopter Company. Both of these aircrafts fought in the Vietnam War and they are the cornerstone of his giving back to our country.One of Jimmy‚Äôs favorite events this year was working with a local Florida veteran who actually served in the 170th in Vietnam as a Crew Chief. It was an honor for Jimmy to hear Vietnam Veteran Steve Crawford share his stories from the past, and reconnect this Crew Chief with a flight in the Huey that shared the skies during his time with the 170th Assault Helicopter Company. The Jimmy Graham Foundation has also partnered with Luna Cafe in Wisconsin to sell the ‚ÄúHuey Blend‚Äù coffee that supports The JG Foundation.Graham has started all nine games this year for the Bears with 35 receptions, 302 yards, and 5 touchdowns.USAA, the presenting sponsor of the award, will contribute $25,000 in the winner‚Äôs name to the official aid societies representing all five military branches. The NFL will match USAA‚Äôs contribution, with the winner deciding which military charity of choice the additional $25,000 will go to."

487,bears,https://www.windycitygridiron.com/2020/11/17/21571420/open-letter-to-the-mccaskey-family,Open Letter to the McCaskey Family,"Chicago Bears Schedule, News, Roster and Stats | Windy City GridironBy Recidivist24 on Nov 17, 2020, 10:13am CST +Dear McCaskeys (and Ted Phillips-McCaskey),With the exception of a few ""blind squirrel finding a nut"" moments, your ownership has been an abject failure. But despite your perpetual inability to build and maintain a functioning football franchise, you have zero qualms about making money hand over fist. It's a comical lack of self-awareness, of understanding that the entire city and the entire NFL is laughing at you and has laughed at you for the last 30+ years. If you had any pride, you'd see what millions of other people see: a family that may be full of nice people, but has no business running a pro sports franchise. This gets back to self-awareness: of having the maturity to say, ""you know, we have no clue what we're doing. We've tried for three decades, we‚Äôve failed, someone else can do much better."" Instead, your stubbornness/cluelessness/general detachment from reality insists that you (looking at you, Ted Phillips) remain key decision-makers perpetuating an endless cycle of failure.Put it this way: someone who knows how to build an organization would hire a football-competent Team President, General Manager, and Head Coach. You have repeatedly done the exact opposite. Your ineptitude leads to hiring people of equal ineptitude, over and over again. Jerry Angelo, Phil Emery, Marc Trestman, Dick Jauron, Matt Nagy, Ryan Pace...they all have one thing in common, and it isn't pigskin ingenuity. Ask yourselves: when has another football franchise coveted any member of your front office or coaching staff? The answer, with the exception of Dave Toub (a Special Teams coach...that's so Bears), is never. Would a sensible football mind ever hire John Schoop? Would a competent organization allow a GM (Pace) to throw $20M+ at a retread QB (Mike Glennon)? I'd need several pages to list your missteps and the millions you‚Äôve wasted over the years. That's kind of the point though: a competent franchise would never have hired woefully overmatched personnel in the first place and allowed them to demonstrate their failings for the world to see.I'll end with this: I'm not suggesting you sell the team. I am suggesting that you look in the mirror, see what everyone else has seen since the late 1980s, and relinquish 100% of football-related decisions to someone who knows what they're doing. Retreat to the country club, play pickleball, do whatever it is you McCaskeys do when you're not effing up the NFL's second-oldest franchise. For everyone's sake ‚Äì Chicagoans, suburbanites, out-of-state football fans who chuck their remote at the T.V. every time the Bears stumble into an MNF slot because they know they'd be better off gouging their eyes out for the ensuing three hours ‚Äì wake up, smell the mess you've created, and bring in competent football minds to clean it up. Some semblance of a ""McCaskey legacy"" is still salvageable, provided you get the eff out of the way.Best Wishes,Recidivist24This Fanpost was written by a Windy City Gridiron member, and does not necessarily reflect the ideas or opinions of its staff or community."

When factoring in yards lost by sacks, the Bears gained a total of 149 offensive yards throughout the night.Despite the return of Cody Whitehair, the activation of Lamar Miller and the transition of play-calling duties to offensive coordinator Bill Lazor, it looked like the same old Chicago offense with little to no signs of improvement.Here are some of the takeaways from Monday‚Äôs action.It was the same old, same old for the Bears‚Äô offense this week.In a poor outing that unfortunately ended in an injury, Nick Foles threw for just 106 yards, completing 15 of his 26 attempts. That 4.1 yards-per-attempt total was indicative of how the Bears‚Äô passing attack was against the Vikings, as they were unable to stretch the field vertically, and Foles was unable to hit his receivers in stride.Allen Robinson led the team with six catches for 43 yards and was treated as somewhat of a reliable security blanket for a Bears offense that was afraid and flat-out incapable of consistently throwing the ball beyond the sticks. After him, no Bears receiver caught more than two passes and finished with over 30 receiving yards. Darnell Mooney had just three yards on two catches‚Äîdespite being the team‚Äôs most explosive deep threat‚ÄîAnthony Miller caught two passes, and Chicago‚Äôs tight ends as a whole combined for just one catch for seven yards: a dump-off to Cole Kmet.The Bears entered the game without David Montgomery, and even though he hasn‚Äôt been exactly great in 2020, his presence was missed against Minnesota. The team as a whole had just 2.4 yards per carry on 17 attempts, with Cordarrelle Patterson ‚Äúleading‚Äù the way with 30 yards on 12 carries. Artavis Pierce had nine yards on three carries, Ryan Nall had a single run go for no gain, and Lamar Miller had just two touches, with both of them being through the air. Chicago‚Äôs offensive line struggled against the Vikings, but their running backs also didn‚Äôt necessarily inspire confidence.Speaking of offensive line, the Bears had yet another disappointing game come from their hog-mollies in the trenches. They allowed two sacks, but the more telling number is the 11 quarterback hits that Foles and Tyler Bray endured, the latter stepping in late in the fourth quarter after Foles got injured. The Bears allowed pressure from essentially every gap, with Minnesota winning off the edge, along the interior, and in the blitz game.Very little went right for the Bears offensively. But, then again, that‚Äôs to be expected at this stage of the season.If there‚Äôs one positive takeaway from Monday‚Äôs game for the Bears, it‚Äôs that Roquan Smith is a bonafide star.The third-year linebacker has proven to be something Chicago doesn‚Äôt have too many of right now: a young, up-and-coming, elite talent. Smith finished the game with a whopping 14 total tackles, including three tackles for a loss, a sack and a quarterback hit. His performance gives him the NFL‚Äôs most tackles for a loss with 15, and it gives him a tie for the league‚Äôs most tackles with 96 through 10 games.He has always been athletic during his time with the Bears, but his mental processing finally looks as quick as it did at Georgia, if not even quicker. That combination allows him to read plays before they happen and close in on ball-carriers or route runners, and Bears fans saw that ability on Monday.Up front, the Bears did a much better job defending the run than one would have expected going in. They held Dalvin Cook to just 3.2 yards per carry on 30 attempts: his worst average in what will likely be an All-Pro season for the running back. Brent Urban played a big part in that performance, as he had six tackles despite playing in just a rotational role. Akiem Hicks and Bilal Nichols each contributed four tackles, and Danny Trevathan did a solid job of executing run fits, tallying eight tackles.One of the most fun defensive plays of the year also came in Monday‚Äôs loss, as Khalil Mack dropped back into coverage and caught an interception, returning it 33 yards. The All-Pro edge rusher had a decent game defensively, but that splash play was certainly a lot of fun to watch.It wasn‚Äôt all perfect for the Bears on defense, though. The middle of the field was, yet again, left wide open throughout a majority of the night, and the Vikings took advantage of it by letting the likes of Justin Jefferson, Kyle Rudolph and Adam Thielen run rampant on crossers, drags and seams. While some of that may fall on the safeties (more so than the linebackers), a lot of that falls on Chuck Pagano‚Äôs inability to scheme zone coverages that effectively protect that part of the field, which has been showcased all year.Jefferson exploded with 135 yards on eight catches, and Jaylon Johnson appeared to be his primary cover man. The former Utah cornerback had a pass deflection and had his fair share of good reps, but it was far from his best game. Buster Skrine also got toasted for two touchdowns out of the slot.The Bears also struggled to put pressure on Kirk Cousins. More often than not, Cousins had a clean pocket and was given ample time to dissect Chicago‚Äôs defense. He was sacked just once‚Äîthe aforementioned Smith sack on a blitz‚Äîand, although he was hit five times, was still given enough time to sit in the pocket.Monday wasn‚Äôt the Bears‚Äô performance defensively, but it was still a pretty good one overall. Their defense was far from the biggest reason they lost.3. The Bears are lucky that their bye week is coming up, because they have a lot of self-evaluating to do.With their falling to 5-5, their chances of making it into the playoffs have severely diminished since their 5-1 start. The offense has shown no signs of life, they are down a couple of key contributors, and they have two injured quarterbacks at the moment. While the severity of Foles‚Äô injury is unknown as of this writing, the expectation is that the Bears will likely have to return to starting Mitchell Trubisky once he returns from his shoulder injury.Admittedly, Trubisky has not been good under center for the Bears, but with the team‚Äôs offensive line issues, maybe it will be better to have a more athletic quarterback in the starting lineup. Regardless, though, their offensive state seems to be at the point of no return.2. Where has Robert Quinn been?Highly touted after signing a five-year, $70 million contract in the offseason, the veteran pass-rusher has been essentially non-existent for the Bears in 2020. He has just one sack after 10 weeks and only has nine tackles as of this writing. He didn‚Äôt make his presence felt much on Monday, either, having one quarterback hit but no tackles.Granted, the Bears aren‚Äôt giving Quinn the playing time of a full-time starting edge rusher, but therein lies the problem. He has been playing poorly when he‚Äôs been on the field, and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where it seems like even Chicago knows he isn‚Äôt making much of an impact.The Bears are tied to Quinn until at least the end of the 2021 season, and even after that they would have to pay a considerable amount in dead cap space to let him go with a post-June 1 designation. If he doesn‚Äôt shape up and shape up soon, he could end up being one of the team‚Äôs worst free agent signings in recent years.1. I feel like I‚Äôve been incredibly negative throughout most of this article, and while I feel justified in doing so considering the current state of the Bears, I do want to end these notes on a high note, no pun intended.If I had to choose which Bears would be named Pro Bowlers through 10 weeks, these are the players I would select:Honorable mentions go to Jaylon Johnson, Eddie Jackson and Allen Robinson.There is a lot wrong with the Bears right now, but there have still been plenty of players performing at a high level."

The Bears overcame a four-game losing streak a year ago but never recovered enough to get past a .500 record.If the Bears want to best that, they have a tall task ahead of them, as the Minnesota Vikings are coming to town for a Monday Night Football match up. Kirk Cousins in primetime? We‚Äôve seen this one before, but with the way Dalvin Cook is playing, Cousins probably doesn‚Äôt need to be perfect.The national pundits that before the season were predicting gloom and so gleefully told the Bears fans that the team would come crashing down are likely reveling in the team‚Äôs recent misfortunes. If Matt Nagy and Co. have any tricks up their sleeves they had better pull them out quick to salvage whatever they can this year.Minnesota VikingsSB Nation site: Daily NorsemanRecord: 3-5, third in NFC NorthLast week: 34-20 win over the Detroit LionsGame day, time, TV: Monday, 7:15 p.m., ESPNBears all-time record against: 56-60-2 (including postseason)Historical meetings: The last time these teams met on Monday Night Football, it didn‚Äôt go the Bears‚Äô way. So let‚Äôs highlight the time before that when it did.Week 8, 2016, the 1-6 Bears met the 5-1 Vikings at Soldier Field. The Bears carried a 13-3 halftime lead on the back of two Conner Barth field goals and a two-yard Jordan Howard run.In the third quarter Jay Cutler led an 11-play, 75 yard touchdown drive, which ended with an 11-yard scoring play to Alshon Jeffery.Jordan Howard run wild over the Vikings for 163 yards and the defense sacked Sam Bradford five times, including two for Akiem Hicks.Strangely there were no turnovers by either team, in a game that involved Sam Bradford and Jay Cutler.The Bears won 20-10.Last meeting: The Bears saved some face in week 17 last year as they salvaged a not-losing record against a Vikings squad that was prepping for the playoffs.Sean Mannion started for Minnesota and Chicago took a strange 11-6 halftime lead after three Eddy Piniero field goals and a safety when Nick Kwiatkoski tackled Mike Boone in the endzone.David Montgomery ran for 113 yards and a third quarter score. The Vikings took the lead in the fourth on a Boone touchdown and two field goals from Dan Bailey.Mitch Trubisky led the Bears down with less than five minutes to play, hitting Riley Ridley on 4th down and 9 from the 49 yard line for 32 yards.The Bears gained another 15 yards with Montgomery and a short pass to Allen Robinson. Then Piniero hit a 22-yard field goal and the Bears won 21-19. Eddie Jackson intercepted Mannion on the final play of the game.Offense: The Vikings offense comes in ranked 12th in points and 11th in yards.Their passing offense ranks 25th but their rushing offense ranks third.That‚Äôs mostly down to Dalvin Cook (144 att./858 yds./12 TD). Last week the Bears faced Derrick Henry, who came in to that game as the NFL‚Äôs leading rusher and this week they will face Cook, who is now the league‚Äôs leading rusher. Not sure how often a team faces the league‚Äôs rushing leader in back-to-back weeks.Spelling Cook is Alexander Mattison (69/322/1) who is averaging a healthy 4.7 YPC himself, so this is a well-balanced ground game.On the passing side, Kirk Cousins (65.6 pct cmp./1,855 yds./15 TD/10 INT) has leveled off after a rough September to start the year but still isn‚Äôt exactly tearing it up. His success is very much dependent on that running game, so bottling up Cook will be imperative for the Bears defense.Catching Cousins‚Äô passes are Adam Thielen (37 rec./480 yds./7 TD), rookie Justin Jefferson (24/627/3), TEs Kyle Rudolph (14/175/1) and Irv Smith Jr. (13/159/2) and once again, Cook (16/173/1).Defense: The defense comes into the game ranked 25th in points allowed and 29th in yards.Their passing defense ranks 30th and their rushing defense ranks 20th.And now here come the Bears to make them look like the Purple People Eaters once again.After trading Yannick Ngakoue, the Vikings now features OLB Eric Wilson (2.5 sk/4 TFL/3 PD/3 INT/1 FF) and Ifeadi Odenigbo (2.5 sk/9 QB hits/2 TFL) as their leading pass rushers.Harrison Smith (2 INT/4 PD/3 QB hits) is still patrolling deep and Eric Kendricks (84 tkl/3 PD/1 INT/2 TFL) is still lurking too.Key match ups: The offense is facing a very bad defense and it should take advantage, but literally nothing comes easy to this group and even with a regular back up back available on the OL and maybe more, there should be fewer excuses, but do you trust them?Allen Robinson should see favorable match ups against rookie CBs Jeff Gladney and Cameron Dantzler. Robinson‚Äôs route running is going to test the young players.The offensive line, if they can get a couple players back this week, have a chance against a not-great Minnesota pass rush. But, that was also said last week.On defense, it‚Äôs going to be about the Bears‚Äô defensive line winning at the line of scrimmage against the Vikings offensive line and shutting down the running lanes for Dalvin Cook. I think the even bigger match up may be Roquan Smith and Danny Trevathan against Cook. Smith and Trevethan have been flying around and making plays, especially in the run game."

The Eagles lost this weekend, 27 to 17 to the Giants, but still lead the division with a 3-5-1 record.The 3-7 Giants are the hottest team in that division with 2 wins in a row, but the Ron Rivera led Washington Football Team (2-7), with comeback quarterback Alex Smith getting them into the playoffs is a story I would love to see.2) The race for first in the NFC West is also going to be a fun one to follow. The Arizona Cardinals, Los Angeles Rams, and Seattle Seahawks are all tied atop the division with 6-4 records and they all have head to head matchups to look forward too.The Rams and Seahawks have playoff experience to fall back on, but there‚Äôs something special about the Cardinals this year. Quarterback Kyler Murray is playing at an MVP level and this ridiculous Hail Mary to DeAndre Hopkins must have this team believing they can do anything.The angle you didn't know you needed of @DeAndreHopkins' catch

(via @AZCardinals) pic.twitter.com/gqIHKjexab3) I found this statistical nugget about Murray intriguing because it mentions former Chicago Bears All-Pro quarterback Johnny Lujack.Arizona quarterback KYLER MURRAY rushed for two touchdowns and threw a game-winning 43-yard touchdown pass with two seconds remaining in the Cardinals‚Äô Week 10 win.Murray is the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era and fourth quarterback in NFL history to rush for a touchdown in five consecutive games, joining JOHNNY LUJACK (six consecutive games in 1950), TOBIN ROTE (five in 1956) and Pro Football Hall of Famer DUTCH CLARK (five in 1936).Murray has 10 rushing touchdowns this season, tied with JOHNNY LUJACK (10) for the most by a quarterback in his team‚Äôs first nine games of a season in league annals.Lujack only played 4 years with the Bears before retiring after his second consecutive Pro Bowl, but he could have gone down in history as one of the Bears all-time greats.4) The NFC South leading New Orleans Saints took a hit with news of quarterback Drew Brees being out for a while with multiple rib fractures and a collapsed lung, but also with some lingering issues to his throwing shoulder that he needs to heal up.Brees being out will give some advanced time for back up QB Jameis Winston to show that the Lasik surgery he had this offseason was well worth it and that he deserves to find a starting gig in 2021.5) The hottest team in the AFC, besides the undefeated Pittsburgh Steelers, is the Miami Dolphins who have won 5 straight games.The Dolphins bucked the trend of getting a young up and coming offensive mind when they hired defensive assistant Brian Flores away from the Patriots in 2019 to be their head coach. At 6-3, Flores already has improved on last year‚Äôs 5-11 record, and he has the ‚ÄòFins currently as the 6th seed in the conference.6) Speaking of the Dolphins, they released running back Jordan Howard yesterday.In five games this year, Howard had 29 offensive touches for 30 yards.There‚Äôs a place in the league for a guy with his skills, but it has to be a place with a great offensive line and a place where his power style will complement the lead back.7) I hate how much I love everything about this play.Davante Adams got UP!

Oh, and that @AaronRodgers12 fake

NFL Game Pass | @packers | @tae15adams pic.twitter.com/FRezbxLTmLFrom the play design, to the pass protection, to Aaron Rodgers‚Äô play fake, to DeVante Adams‚Äô lulling the defensive back to sleep before kicking it into high gear, and then finally jumping up for the catch.Just a pretty play.Damn.8) This was a heady play by Nick Chubb.Nick Chubb ripped off a 59-yard run and stopped at the 1-yard line

(via @thecheckdown)pic.twitter.com/IK5Pbpyyi1It may have sucked for some of your fantasy teams, but it allowed the Browns to take 2 knees and get out of there with a win to move to 6-3.A few weeks ago we saw Atlanta‚Äôs Todd Gurley try to pull up before scoring a TD against the Lions, but his momentum carried him across the goal line, which led to Detroit having enough time to drive down and score the game winner.9) And speaking of the Lions... They pulled off another miraculous comeback, this time against Washington, as Matthew Stafford drove then into field goal range with just 16 seconds left in the game. Two Stafford completions sandwiched around a roughing the passer penalty gave kicker Matt Prater time for this.59 yards FOR THE WIN!!

Another @MattPrater_5 walkoff pic.twitter.com/PeYaD4d50I10) I‚Äôm a fan of Allen Robinson‚Äôs, but I don‚Äôt think the Bears should sign him to a long term contract or hit him with the franchise tag this offseason. This Bears team has too many offensive issues, and while a number one wide out is nice to have, it‚Äôs nicer if there‚Äôs a quarterback that can get him the ball consistently and if there‚Äôs an offensive line that can give consistent protection so the QB can do his job.Until the Bears figure out their line and quarterback, there‚Äôs no point in locking Robinson down for the 2021 season. Either let him walk and get a comp pick, or tag him with the sole intention of trading him.Plus, he clearly seems frustrated with the current state of his offense, and his agent was Tweeting his frustrations last night too.10a) I was a guest this morning on the SB Nation NFL Show and I got to talk about the sad state of the Bears..."

Esraem was the week‚Äôs high scorer with 10 points. Jeff‚Äôs in fourth, Lester in 11th, Patti in 14th and WhiskeyRanger in 20th.Now let‚Äôs look at this week‚Äôs game, against the Vikings at home.Minnesota Vikings (-2.5) at Chicago Bears (O/U 44)Monday, 7:15 p.m. CT, ESPNSam: Look, we‚Äôre all down on the Bears. The offense is about as abysmal as I can remember and I remember 2004, 2014, 2005, 2016 and 2017, among others.Anyway, this offense can‚Äôt move the ball two yards without some kind of penalty. Their lowlights should be played with Yakety Sax dubbed over.All of that said, this is an immovable object (the Bears with the football) against an unstoppable force (Kirk Cousins in primetime).Cousins in 0-9 on Monday Night Football and we all know his prime time record is not good (7-16). But the Vikings have Dalvin Cook and are averaging 27.1 points per game.So this one comes down to do you trust the defense to shut down Cook enough for the offense to be able to outpace the Vikings?I don‚Äôt know, but I do know that a law of betting is that intra-division home underdogs are nearly a must-bet. It‚Äôs tried and true.They‚Äôre short home dogs and I don‚Äôt feel great about it, but I‚Äôm taking the points and playing the Bears. I think the defense will ball out against Cook and Cousins and even if they don‚Äôt win, they‚Äôll keep it close.I‚Äôll once again take the under, the Vikings and Bears have combined for more than 44 points just twice in the last six years.In the survivor pool I‚Äôm taking the Saints against the 49ers. While the Packers are tempting, I‚Äôm saving them for later, I think the Saints can win outright.Picks: Bears +2.5, under 44, Saints (survivor)JB: Sam says the under bet didn‚Äôt work out last week but I cashed my under bet in the Bears Titans game so not sure if Sam caught a bad line last week or what. I know I cashed it because it was the only bet I ended up making because I was so sure the offense would suffer with 4 out of 5 backup offensive linemen. And in case you didn‚Äôt watch that same Titans defense get steamrolled by the Colts last night, I‚Äôll remind you that the Titans defense is mediocre at best.So, what can we expect against a suddenly resurgent Vikings squad? The Vikings are inexperienced in the secondary - great for most teams to take advantage of but might not mean much for the Bears. The Vikings have also found joy with Dalvin Cook in the run game, something the Bears have struggled with early in the season, but have improved as of late.Nagy‚Äôs crew has matched up well with the Vikings since his arrival and this is, don‚Äôt kid yourself, an absolute must win for the Bears if they still want to make a playoff run. With the bye week just ahead, this game means everything for the Bears. If the Bears lose, they‚Äôll carry a four game losing streak into the bye and amplify calls for Nagy‚Äôs head.I think, given the do-or-die circumstances, I‚Äôll take the Bears with the points. I agree with Sam that the smart money remains on the under, but I have a feeling this bounces in a different direction so I‚Äôll take the over.As for Survivor, I‚Äôm taking the Pa... hmmm... the Pack... blegh... the Packers. They‚Äôve got a home date with the Jaguars, are playing well, and have the biggest spread of the week. Let‚Äôs burn them here and never speak of this again.Picks: Bears +2.5, Under 44, Packers."

This week, we‚Äôll take an in-depth look at cornerback Jaylon Johnson.Name: Jaylon JohnsonPosition: CornerbackNumber: 33Age: 21Time with Bears: RookieThe Past:‚ÄúSix seconds to go in the game. Stafford again going into the endzone. Tipped, incomplete! It was Jaylon Johnson, the rookie, knocking it away and the game is over!‚ÄùWelcome to the NFL, young buck.The football program at the University of Utah doesn‚Äôt get the respect it probably deserves. After all, they‚Äôve only been in a Power-5 conference for a decade now. It was a just quick head coaching stop for Urban Meyer, before he took over at bigger schools like Florida and Ohio State. It‚Äôs in a state without a border to a solid recruiting hub of players. All the good LDS (Mormon) players go play at BYU, right?In 2004, Utah promoted Kyle Whittingham to the helm of their program, and he‚Äôs been quietly amassing success ever since. With the exception of a 2-year stretch between 2012-13, the team has finished above .500 every year under Whittingham. In those winning seasons, they‚Äôve had: Back-to-back Las Vegas Bowl victories, a win over Marvin Jones Jr. and the California Golden Bears in the Poinsettia Bowl, and an impressive 2009 Sugar Bowl upset win over Alabama to cap off a perfect 13-0 season.So maybe it‚Äôs less surprising that the #16 cornerback in the nation wanted to play for the Utes.Jaylon Johnson was part of a solid recruiting class. According to ESPN, Johnson was one of five 4-star recruits that year. Johnson was the most highly-touted recruit though, and for a reason. In just his second game as a freshman, he rewarded coach Whittingham well. In the ‚ÄúHoly War‚Äù matchup with BYU, Cougars quarterback Tanner Mangum dropped back and threw a rushed pass as the edges of his pocket collapsed around him. His receiver had run a good route, but the ball was underthrown. 18-year old Jaylon Johnson ran under it and secured the interception. Utah won that game, making it their 7th consecutive victory in the heated rivalry between the two schools. Johnson also finished that game with 2 passes defensed, and finished the year with a healthy stat line of 23 solo tackles, 6 passes defensed.Johnson broke out in his sophomore year, with an exceptional 8-tackle game against Northern Illinois University and an interception in an upset win over the University of Southern California. His highlight of the year, though, came against Stanford. KJ Costello, junior quarterback for the Cardinal, dropped back to throw in the red zone and saw his man with a potential 1-on-1 matchup in the endzone. Unfortunately for Costello, the receiver wasn‚Äôt on the same page. He failed to box out, and Johnson undercut a float pass in stride. With nobody to outrun but Costello himself, Johnson was able to track 100 yards the other direction for a touchdown, the first score of his college career. He finished his sophomore year with 31 solo tackles, including 2 tackles for a loss, and 4 interceptions.Johnson began his junior year with another impressive game against BYU, this time with a pass breakup and 4 solo tackles. A month later, against Washington State, he picked off his first pass of the season. The next game, against Oregon State: 7 solo tackles. Johnson established himself as a well-rounded cornerback who can play all over, and go stride-for-stride with the best receivers in the game. After his standout junior season, including another impressive undercut route for a pick-6 against Washington, Johnson was named to the First-Team All-PAC-12 squad. With an invite to the NFL combine and a few NFL draft scouts watching his tape, Johnson elected to take his talents to the pros.The Present:The Bears selected Johnson with the latter of their second-round picks after claiming Cole Kmet to secure their tight end position. Chicago desperately needed stability at the cornerback position opposite Kyle Fuller, with veteran Prince Amukumara cut as a cap casualty (on top of health concerns) and undrafted 3rd-year cornerback Kevin Toliver filling in for stretches of 2019. Once drafted, Johnson entered training camp competing with Toliver, former 1st-round pick Artie Burns, and the as-yet-unproven Duke Shelley for the starting cornerback position. Toliver was cut, Burns didn‚Äôt last long before ending up on IR, and Johnson earned his spot to cover receivers in front of star safety Eddie Jackson.Johnson has performed extraordinarily well in his first year as a pro, not only by rookie standards but by all popular metrics for grading cornerbacks. He‚Äôs already racked up 22 solo tackles through the first half of the season, and broken up 12 passes to go along with it. After 2 weeks of the 2020 season, Pro Football Focus ranked the Bears rookie as the 3rd highest-graded cornerback in the NFL. Again, that‚Äôs not just rookies, that‚Äôs the entire NFL. At the midway point in the season, PFF still has him on their All-Rookie team. He‚Äôs been disciplined, too, with only 3 defensive pass interference penalties called against him in a year where it feels like the DPI flags are thrown before the ball even is. If there‚Äôs a weak spot to this Bears secondary, it surely isn‚Äôt Jaylon Johnson.The future:Johnson is going to be a staple of this Bears defensive secondary for years to come. He‚Äôs only a rookie and his starting spot is well-secured, and if injuries don‚Äôt prevent it, then he should earn a second contract by the end of his third year in Chicago. With Kyle Fuller only 28, and Eddie Jackson 26 years old, the no-fly zone at Soldier Field should only get scarier for opponents.The one stat which is missing from Johnson‚Äôs professional career thus far is interceptions. He has yet to pick off a pass, although he had the opportunities. Tipped passes are more what he does best, and it will likely take a teammate tipping a ball up and Johnson running under it to secure an easy interception. Luckily, Kirk Cousins leads the Minnesota Vikings into Chicago for a Monday Night Football matchup. If history is any indication, ‚ÄúPrimetime‚Äù Kirk Cousins will show up and start giving away freebies. Mark it down, Johnson will get his first NFL pick in this one.Week 10 prediction:2 solo, 4 total tackles, 1 INT, 1 PD"

A win on Monday Night Football against the Minnesota Vikings will get them to 6-4 and put a little pressure on the other NFC teams positioning for a wildcard spot.Some of the WCG staffers gave their keys to the Bears pulling off the upset this week.Erik Christopher Duerrwaechter:Offense: Activate Lamar Miller and let him do his thing, while giving Cole Kmet an actual opportunity in the receiving game. There‚Äôs a chance David Montgomery might miss the game due to a concussion, and Miller could be ready to go this week. Lamar Miller will bring a different, more explosive skillset to the backfield. Meanwhile, it‚Äôs time to just unleash Cole Kmet, and let him prove himself of being worth an early draft pick.Defense: Continue to own Kirk Cousins. Even when the Bears had almost all 11 spots on defense filled by backups last year, Kirk Cousins couldn‚Äôt do much at all. Khalil Mack has feasted in the 4 games played so far. Perhaps we will see an emergence of Robert Quinn while we‚Äôre at it.Special Teams: Set Dwayne Harris up for good returns. He‚Äôs taken Ted Ginn Jr.‚Äôs job, and he‚Äôs looking to run away with it. I think the Vikings‚Äô punt return unit will give up a big play or two during the middle of the game.Robert Zeglinski:Hollow out the the pumpkin that is Kirk Cousins and create a few defensive points out of his neat pulp, or fall in graceless defeat, again, because there‚Äôs no way the Bears offense by itself scores more than 20 points.WhiskeyRanger:Offense: Do... something. Anything. Find SOME way to move the ball outside of garbage time. Protect your QB any way you can, and concentrate on plays with short passing routes, and easy dump-offs. Don‚Äôt give the defense time to get to him. There was a time when Nick Foles was cool under pressure. He‚Äôs not any more. He looks more and more gun shy at the slightest hint of pressure as the weeks tick by. Not that I can completely blame him, given the state of the o-line.Defense: It‚Äôs Kirk Cousins. The blueprint for stopping him isn‚Äôt compicated. Get within 10 feet of him and he‚Äôs liable to throw a pick. So, get within 10 feet, and catch the dang interception. Other than that, bottle up Dalvin Cook as best you can. The Bears Defense did a pretty good job doing just that to Derrick Henry.Special Teams: All‚Äôs good here. A bit better blocking on returns would be nice, but I‚Äôm not about to get greedy given what we‚Äôve all been through during the ‚ÄúTed Ginn Era‚Äù. Just being good is good enough for me at this point.Ken Mitchell:The defense will need to win this game, since the offense is only going to score a maximum of 24 points.Attack Kirk Cousins. Early. Often. Spook him. He will turn the ball over, he always does against this defense.Sam Householder:To beat the Vikings you have to beat Dalvin Cook. Stop him and Kirk Cousins will be Kirk Cousins, by that I mean turn the ball over and be below average. If you want Primetime Cousins, you have to stop Cook first and foremost.Robert Schmitz:Offense: Do your job. No, this isn‚Äôt a message to the offense in total, it‚Äôs a message to each individual offensive player ‚Äî right now, the plays that are being called aren‚Äôt even getting executed, and just like how a pitcher can‚Äôt throw a curveball that doesn‚Äôt have any curve you can‚Äôt run plays with only 10 men executing correctly. These assignment issues have to stop or else nothing will change. Do your job.Defense: Shut down the running game. In 2020, a 3 yard gain on the ground might as well be an incompletion, so if you can keep Dalvin Cook from breaking off monster runs (See: Week 8, Green Bay) you‚Äôll put the game more on Kirk Cousins‚Äô shoulders. And if we‚Äôve learned anything about Cousins‚Äô performance under the bright divisional Monday night lights.... that‚Äôs as safe a set of shoulders as the Bears could ask for.Special Teams: Really no problems here. Keep it up.Patti Curl:Get Mustipher or Whitehair or Eric Kush up and running to play center. If not, turn your offensive line into a donut so it needs no center. Figure that position out, and the Bears will have a spectacled bear‚Äôs chance in a strip mall LensCrafters of leaving the day smiling.Lester A. Wiltfong Jr.:Rumors are circulating that Matt Nagy may be giving up play calling (EDIT: It‚Äôs no longer a rumor), and while that may give this offense a spark, if the players don‚Äôt execute it won‚Äôt matter. Sure there have been instances where a play call left me shaking my head, but there have been far more times where the play failed due to shoddy execution from the players.So here‚Äôs my one and only key for this week‚Äôs game. Keep it as simple as possible because the offensive line isn‚Äôt good enough to do anything more than the basics.This means stick with zone blocking on the runs, let Foles have some more RPOs, and go max protect on pass plays. If a corner is giving a wide out a nice cushion, then Foles has to be able to snap the ball out to him. Sure it may only be a gain of a few yards, but those quick hitters take the place of the running game, and until this o-line shows it can move someone off the line, the quick passing game has to be used to soften things up.What are your keys to the game this week?"

Some of the topics on the podcast include:The toughest pill to swallow from Parkins came when talking about how the offense could be fixed for this season. The way Danny looks at it, it certainly doesn‚Äôt seem like there‚Äôs any hope for this season.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a total complete failure. Other than Allen Robinson and maybe Darnell Mooney, there isn‚Äôt a single piece of the offense that you would grade as even being average, much less above average,‚Äù Parkins explained. ‚ÄúNone of it is special. They have no good run blockers. They have no team speed. They have very little tight end production in terms of yardage; Jimmy Graham has been okay in the red zone. There‚Äôs nothing good. There‚Äôs no strength about it. It really is a collective failure.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs certainly not a ringing endorsement from Parkins. It‚Äôs a great podcast, so check it out below!"

There‚Äôs been a downward spiral feel to the whole operation which has been fueled by the combination of a disheartening losing streak and a tragicomedy of offensive impotence.So I came into this game determined to enjoy my Bears no matter the outcome.You can guess how that went....the Bears offense regroups as we cut to Bill Lazor in the booth, furiously clipboarding up the perfect play to keep the Bears on track. He calls it down to Nicky Foles, who eagerly relays it to his teammates, who set up quickly. The ball snaps. An unblocked rusher sacks Foles within 2 seconds for a 7 yard loss.Classic Bears.It makes it easier for him to drag you down from behind in the backfield. Hahahahaha. We‚Äôll were talking about Smith, his team-leading 14 tackles, team-leading 1 sacks, and team‚Äôs only tackles for loss, were 14 of few bright spots in this game.If I had to make a complaint about the Bears defense, it would be how frequently the first tackler fails to bring down his target. But I don‚Äôt have to, so let‚Äôs just call them perfect. Either way, it wasn‚Äôt crazy to expect Davin Cook would slip a few past them.People are always mad when Mack drops back into coverage. Usually it‚Äôs Bears fans, but tonight it was Kirk Cousins, who was so distracted by the move that he threw right into Mack‚Äôs welcome arms.Would have made him the Bears top rusher if they were rushing yards and the Bears second receiver if they were receiving yards. Put that Bear on offense!If the Bears were never destined to have offensive superstars, we‚Äôve ‚Äúmade up for it‚Äù with a wealth of transcendent special teams dream runs.Dwayne Harris‚Äô catch every ball motto was welcome after watching Ted Ginn‚Äôs ball-is-lava punt philosophy in play earlier in the season. That plan only works if you actually catch the ball though. Anthony Miller looked good stepping in after Harris was put in the dog house.Seriously. He gave his all just to avoid a sack. Sure, the throw was 50-50 an interception, but he pulled it off.Da Box ScoreIs not encouraging...Finding joy in this Bears game was a tall order. I can‚Äôt pretend I succeeded to the level I‚Äôd hoped. It doesn‚Äôt feel the same as when I could root for the bumbling John Fox Bears did anything mediocre. The difference is that there is talent on this team that deserves to be rewarded for their play, and there‚Äôs (intermittent) reasons for hope. I genuinely like Matt Nagy even as my optimism for his coaching wanes. Even Ryan Pace has his charms and successes, and I don‚Äôt enjoy the thought watching Staley hand him his pink slip."

2018 - 17 Nagy
2019 - 22 Nagy
2020 - 20 NagyAnd now let‚Äôs get down to the nitty gritty.Sack 16 - First Quarter 2:43 - Sheldon Rankins and Marcus Davenport
You guys remember this first sack, don‚Äôt you? It left me shaking my head at the TV when they showed the replay.The New Orleans Saints run a nice T-E stunt at the Bears left side, and left guard Rashaad Coward turns and chases before he realizes what‚Äôs happening.What he should have done was keep his shoulders square, shuffle out towards his left tackle (closing the B-gap), then passed his man off while waiting for the defensive end to come back to him. With Coward offering ZERO resistance, he allows his man to get to his left tackle‚Äôs inside shoulder too quick, which makes this an impossible block for Charles Leno Jr. to make as he‚Äôs still processing his own pass off inside.I have no idea what Coward is even doing on this play. This one is on him.Sack 17 - Third Quarter 11:51 - Malcolm Jenkins
Much like Coward was burned for turning his shoulders on that first sack, this time it‚Äôs right tackle Jason Spriggs that didn‚Äôt keep his shoulders square. The hesitation blitz was nice, but Spriggs was too quick to turn outside and wasn‚Äôt in position to do anything.Running back David Montgomery was part of the pass protection on the left side along with tight end Cole Kmet, so they had enough bodies (7) to cover the six Saint rushers. Spriggs just opened the door for linebacker Demario Davis (#56), and it was that pressure that initially flustered Nick Foles. The Saints had the Bears receivers covered up, but with no pocket to step up into, Foles was a sitting duck.Had Davis gave a more decisive coffeehouse blitz move ‚Äî by either dropping back to spy or turning his shoulders away to simulate dropping into coverage ‚Äî before rushing, then I probably would have put this in the Sacks Happen category, but since he simply hesitated before blitzing I‚Äôm giving this sack allowed to Spriggs.Sack 18 - Fourth Quarter :28 - Cameron Jordan
This one is also on Spriggs as he just whiffs on Jordan‚Äôs quick inside move and is on Foles in just about two seconds.If Foles had time to come to his second read, he may be able to hit the crossing Anthony Miller, but with Jordan on him so quickly he goes down. Also, while Coward at left guard does a better job with stunt recognition, I‚Äôd like to see him be able to anchor a bit and not get pushed back so easily.Sack 19 - Overtime 6:07 - David Onyemata
I‚Äôm not a fan of what Spriggs is doing on this play either, but I also have no idea what right guard Germain Ifedi is doing at all.The Bears are running a play action so Spriggs, and the other o-linemen, are all stepping to the left to give the impression an outside zone is coming. Spriggs has a relative easy block if he just stays with his man (#93, David Onyemata), but for some reason he stands his ground and releases him inside. Even if Spriggs was expecting Ifedi to be near to pick Onyemata up, there‚Äôs no other threat that Spriggs should be concerned with.Foles rides out the fake, then settles back to try to hit Darnell Mooney running down the field. On the FOX broadcast, Troy Aikman mentioned that Foles, ‚Äúgot hung up on the deep ball,‚Äù and with the Saintgs taking Mooney away, Foles should have looked to Allen Robinson who crosses from his right to left. It would have been a tight throw, but it was better than taking a sack. This one is on Foles.Sack 20 - First Quarter 4:42 - Trey Hendrickson
This play shoes just how unathletic Foles is, but the heady veteran is just as guilty as his predecessor by rolling outside the pocket and taking an unnecessary sack. Once he clears the tackle to tackle box he‚Äôs free to chuck the ball out of bounds to save the loss in yards.Sure it was a third and ten, and he likely knew they were going to punt on fourth down, but don‚Äôt lose four yards when you don‚Äôt have to, especially in overtime. If Foles didn‚Äôt get squeezed from both edges and forced to move up, he may have been able to hit Robinson who comes settling over the middle, but he was bumped on the step up and escaped to the left. This one is on Foles since he evaded the pressure and ate the sack.2020 Individual Sackwatch after 8 games:Bobby Massie - 3‚Öì

It‚Äôs been excruciating to sit through a Bears games these last couple of years.And then when other NFL games are on, I just find myself watching teams and wondering what it‚Äôs like to cheer for a team that scores offensive touchdowns.It‚Äôs the same old story most of my adult life with mediocre Bear offenses not being able to do enough to help out Chicago‚Äôs (usually) good defenses. But in the case of the Bears from the last two seasons, them playing mediocre would be an upgrade because what we‚Äôve seen has been some of the worst offensive football in the history of the franchise. Especially when considering how the rules have been slanted to help offense‚Äôs flourish.Chicago may be 5-5, but their offense is down in the winless territory of the New York Jets.Offensive ranks this season:

32. JetsIn fact, the worst offensive output from the Jets this year ‚Äî in terms of total yards ‚Äî was the 191 they put up week 7 against the Bills. Last night in their loss to the Vikings, the Bears racked up a grand total of 149 yards.For some perspective, the Bears had 219 yards between the kickoffs, punts, and interception return yards last night.The Bears went 2 for 11 on third downs, they were 0 for 2 on fourth downs, they ran a season low 50 offensive snaps with a time of possession of just 24:10, while picking up 10 first downs.But now let‚Äôs take a closer look at the playing time break downs for the Bears, and also some individual stats.Nick Foles was off most of the night, and it wasn‚Äôt all because of the pass protection this week. He wasn‚Äôt accurate and he missed some hot reads that he normally makes. Overall he was just 15 of 26 for 106 yards, with 1 interception and a passer rating of 51.1. The Vikings defense had 2 sacks and had 11 quarterback hits.Cordarrelle Patterson led the Bears in rushing with 30 yards on 12 carries, he had 2 catches for 19 yards, and he had the Bears lone TD on a 104 yard kickoff return.The Bears leading receiver was Allen Robinson with 6 receptions for 43 yards.Roquan Smith has been playing damn good football all year long and he had a game high 14 tackles, a sack, 3 tackles for loss and a QB hit.Danny Trevathan (8 tackles) and Eddie Jackson (7 tackles) each had a forced fumble, with Tashaun Gipson (3 tackles) getting a fumble recovery.Brent Urban led the d-line with 6 tackles.Khalil Mack had an interception and 3 tackles.*The above image has players that only played in the third phase.Patrick O‚ÄôDonnell had 5 punts with a 44.2 average while placing 2 inside the twenty yard line.Cairo Santos nailed his lone extra point, he was 2 for 2 on field goals, and all 4 of his kickoffs went for touchbacks.Deon Bush had the Bears only special teams tackle.To check out the full Bears vs Vikings box score I find that ESPN has an easy to navigate site.All statistics and snap counts are taken directly from the NFL‚Äôs Game Statistic and Information System, as are the accompanying pictures."

Well, there was a fourth sack, but a Titan penalty negated it.Yay!Quarterback Nick Foles was pressured all afternoon and he was forced to throw off his back foot several times. He never looked comfortable, and even though the Bears designed plenty of quick throws and moving pockets for him, it wasn‚Äôt enough to thwart the Titan pass rush.Sack 21 - Second Quarter 3:58 - Jayon Brown
I like the design of this play, but with the talent on the Bears offense, I‚Äôm not surprised it failed. The Bears run a play action with the o-line all blocking to the left, but right tackle Rashaad Coward allows too much penetration. All he has to do he get into his man and drive him down the line, but that didn‚Äôt happen.Rookie tight end Cole Kmet, who is lined up next to Coward, starts off blocking left, but then when the linebacker (#55 Jayon Brown) doesn‚Äôt come at him immediately, he turns his attention away towards the edge rusher. This opens the door for the Brown to attack the quarterback and clean up the sack. Kmet should have stayed home knowing that Jimmy Graham was coming back across the formation for the edge rusher.Kmet deserves blame on this sack allowed, but I can‚Äôt give Coward a pass for giving up the B-gap so easily. This one is split with half the blame on each.Sack 22 - Third Quarter 7:18 - Harold Landry III
Leaving Jimmy Graham one on one to block anyone seems like a dumb decision. Letting him chip or help is fine, but on this play it seems like the Bears were sliding protection to the right, which meant Graham was one on one with Landry.It looks like left tackle Charles Leno Jr. was in position to get Landry if he stayed home, but with the way the line slid protection right, his initial responsibility was the B-gap between he and left guard Arlington Hambright. Leno had no way of knowing that the Titan defensive tackle was going to kick all the way down to test the A-gap until it was too late to help back out on Landry.Graham was even leaning inside on his three-point stance, but he was late in cutting Landry off. Running back David Montgomery was coming across the formation to get the defensive back off the edge, so once Graham lost leverage this play was doomed. This one is on Graham, but before we move on to the last sack, take a peek at the right tackle Coward.Come on man...Sack 23 - Fourth Quarter 13:55 - DaQuan Jones and Rashaan Evans
This was the blown up shovel pass, and what really sucks is had Allen Robinson not been knocked off his track he had a nice hole to run through.A shovel pass is essentially a one route pass play, so with A-Rob not an option, there‚Äôs nothing for Foles to do but run. Coward gets too high off the snap, but center Alex Bars deserves some of the blame on this one as well. With right guard Germain Ifedi pulling to the left, it‚Äôs Bars‚Äô responsibility to cut off the A-gap penetration to his right.On the FOX replay you can see Coward get hit by two Titans and pushed back into Robinson which killed this play. Bars and Coward each get a half sack allowed on this one.Now let‚Äôs take a look at how all 23 sacks allowed have been divvied up so far this season.2020 Individual Sackwatch after 9 games:Bobby Massie - 3‚Öì

It may not be the player you‚Äôre expecting...We are officially nine weeks into the 2020 NFL regular season, and the pretenders have slowly begun to weed themselves out of contention.The teams who will be fighting for the first overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft are apparent at this point, while the strong Super Bowl contenders are starting to become more clear by the week.One such team who falls in that dreaded middle ground is the Bears, who at 5-4 are currently on track to miss the playoffs, but aren‚Äôt picking high enough to secure a top-tier quarterback in the first round.Though there‚Äôs still plenty of games left to be played this year, we have been running draft coverage throughout the course of this season, throughout the good times and the bad. With that latter period taking place at this time of the year, now is as good of a time as any to take an early look at how the first round of the 2021 draft could play out.For the sake of this mock, I will not be projecting trades yet. There will certainly be deals taking place in the first round when next April comes around, but this mock draft is meant to provide more of a standing of how the draft class is shaping up, as well as where NFL teams currently stand in the draft order, for which Tankathon is to be thanked for tracking.A lot will change between now and Draft Day, but for the time being, let‚Äôs take a shot at how the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft might play out.1. New York Jets: Trevor Lawrence, QB, ClemsonLawrence will be the No. 1 pick. The Jets have massive holes at almost every position, but securing a quarterback with the physical tools and the resum√© as good as Lawrence‚Äôs is a great start for their rebuild.2. Jacksonville Jaguars: Justin Fields, QB, Ohio StateWhile Gardner Minshew has surpassed expectations as a sixth-round pick in 2019, that shouldn‚Äôt stop the Jaguars from taking Fields, an accurate, athletic and productive quarterback who can grow into a top-10 signal-caller in the league.3. Dallas Cowboys: Gregory Rousseau, EDGE, Miami (FL)Taking Penei Sewell here was an incredibly tempting move, and while he is likely the better player than Rousseau, the Cowboys have a dreadful defense, and they will still have Tyron Smith and La‚Äôel Collins at tackle. Rousseau‚Äôs athleticism and massive ceiling could give Dallas a fantastic pass-rusher alongside DeMarcus Lawrence.4. New York Giants: Penei Sewell, OT, OregonDrafting Andrew Thomas in the first round in 2020 shouldn‚Äôt stop the Giants from drafting Sewell if he‚Äôs available. A nearly flawless offensive line prospect, Sewell could likely slide right in as a left tackle and play at a near-Pro Bowl level from Day 1, while moving Thomas to his natural right tackle position.5. Washington Football Team: Zach Wilson, QB, BYUThe biggest rising star in the 2021 draft, Wilson has quickly catapulted into being one of the best prospects in the class. His accuracy, arm talent, quick release, and athleticism are all the marks of a franchise quarterback, and it‚Äôs clear that Dwayne Haskins isn‚Äôt the answer in Washington. Sorry, Bears fans.6. Los Angeles Chargers: Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase, WR, LSUThe Chargers need help along their offensive line, but there aren‚Äôt any tackles worth taking this early with Sewell gone. Chase is a fluid and physical receiver with top-notch ball skills, and even though wide receiver isn‚Äôt Los Angeles‚Äô biggest need, it would be smart to take the player who might be the best available at this point of the draft.7. Miami Dolphins (via Texans): Micah Parsons, LB, Penn StateMiami‚Äôs defense has already looked impressive in 2020, but adding a linebacker like Parsons, who is big, explosive and versatile, could help the Dolphins put together an even stronger unit. A wide receiver is tempting here, but the drop-off at the linebacker position after the top of the class is much larger.8. Cincinnati Bengals: Kyle Pitts, TE, FloridaLike the Chargers, the Bengals need an overhaul along the offensive line, but the value doesn‚Äôt work out here. Pitts is as good of a tight end prospect as there has been in many years, and his combination of athleticism, physicality, and route-running savvy would give Joe Burrow a potential All-Pro as a security blanket.9. Carolina Panthers: Patrick Surtain II, CB, AlabamaAn offensive lineman could make sense here for the Panthers, but Carolina‚Äôs secondary could use some beefing up, and with James Bradberry gone, they need a reliable press cornerback. Surtain is a long and fluid corner with impressive ball skills and sharp instincts.10. Atlanta Falcons: Trey Lance, QB, North Dakota StateThe Falcons can‚Äôt move on from Matt Ryan until after the 2021 season, which lines up perfectly with the philosophy of drafting a quarterback this year and having him sit under the former MVP for a year. Lance isn‚Äôt pro-ready yet, but his arm strength and athleticism are top-notch, and placing him in an offense with Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley would be a perfect landing spot for him.11. Detroit Lions: Jaylen Waddle, WR, AlabamaKenny Golladay is a free agent after the 2020 season, but whether or not the Lions bring him back, they could use a reliable speed demon in their offense. Waddle would have been a top-10 pick if not for an ankle injury: his athleticism, route-running IQ and agility make him one of the best overall players in this draft.12. Minnesota Vikings: Wyatt Davis, iOL, Ohio StateThe Vikings have made some additions to their offensive line in the draft in recent years, but they could still use some help along the interior. Davis would be a great addition with his powerful and intelligent style of play at guard.13. New England Patriots: DeVonta Smith, WR, AlabamaIf the Patriots pick high enough to take a quarterback, they will likely do so. However, they have a massive need at the wide receiver position, and Smith is a fluid athlete and a polished route runner who would step in right away and succeed for Bill Belichick and Co.14. Denver Broncos: Caleb Farley, CB, Virginia TechCornerback isn‚Äôt the biggest need on the Broncos‚Äô roster, but it is a need, and with Farley still being available at this stage of the first round, adding the fluid ballhawk to their secondary could be a smart move here.15. San Francisco 49ers: Creed Humphrey, iOL, OklahomaThe 49ers could be interested in a quarterback here, but with their massive need along the interior offensive line, Humphrey makes sense with his mauler mentality, sound use of pads and high football IQ.16. Chicago Bears: Samuel Cosmi, OT, TexasThe temptation of drafting a quarterback here is a strong one, but since this mock draft has no trades, the Bears likely won‚Äôt find good value at the position without moving up. A potential star at offensive tackle is a strong consolation prize, though, as Cosmi‚Äôs length, athleticism and intelligence would allow him to instantly boost Chicago‚Äôs rough offensive line.17. Cleveland Browns: Rashod Bateman, WR, MinnesotaCleveland can save over $15 million by trading Odell Beckham Jr. this offseason, a move that appears likely with the dysfunction between the two sides. Bateman would be a good replacement, as he is a physical, fluid and intelligent wideout with a high ceiling at the next level.18. Indianapolis Colts: Kyle Trask, QB, FloridaThe Colts have fewer needs than the Bears and an abundance of cap space, so they are in a much better position to draft a quarterback in Round 1, even if it is a reach. Trask has improved greatly in 2020 and has the accuracy and pocket presence to be a real threat behind the Colts‚Äô dominant offensive line.19. Philadelphia Eagles: Dylan Moses, LB, AlabamaWhile the Eagles could go in several different directions here, they would be smart to just secure the best player available. Moses is not only tremendous value here, but he fills a big need, and his athleticism and reliable tackling ability makes him a great value at this stage in the first round.20. Arizona Cardinals: Rashawn Slater, iOL, NorthwesternThe Cardinals‚Äô offense has looked great this year, but they could still use some help along the offensive line. Slater is an athletic and intelligent player who can play at just about any offensive line spot, which would give him plenty of versatility.21. Miami Dolphins: Rondale Moore, WR, PurdueMoore may fall a little bit since he barely played in 2019 and hasn‚Äôt played in 2020 as of this writing, but his tremendous athleticism and big-play ability could make him a fantastic addition for the Dolphins, who would be wise to stack up more weapons for Tua Tagovailoa.22. Jacksonville Jaguars (via Rams): Alex Leatherwood, OT, AlabamaGrabbing Leatherwood this late would be really good value for the Jaguars, who would likely love to add the athletic and polished tackle as a blind-side replacement for Cam Robinson to protect Fields.23. Las Vegas Raiders: Kwity Paye, EDGE, MichiganMaxx Crosby has been a reliable force for the Raiders‚Äô defense, but is it too early to give up on Clelin Ferrell? With an explosive, well-built and powerful pass-rusher like Paye available here, Las Vegas may consider pulling the trigger.24. Tennessee Titans: Pat Freiermuth, TE, Penn StateThere‚Äôs a chance the Titans could re-sign Jonnu Smith, but with several key contributors also heading into free agency after the year, tight end could be a need for them going forward. Getting Freiermuth this late is a steal, as he is essentially everything you‚Äôd want in a prototypical ‚ÄòY‚Äô tight end and more.25. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Travis Etienne, RB, ClemsonWhat to get for a Buccaneers team that doesn‚Äôt have too many needs? An understudy for Tom Brady would make sense if the value wasn‚Äôt bad here, but adding the explosive and versatile Etienne to their backfield would give them a potential Pro Bowl back to complement their stellar receiving corp.26. New York Jets (via Seahawks): Dillon Radunz, OT, North Dakota StateThe Jets appear to have a stud along the offensive line in Mekhi Becton, but there‚Äôs no such thing as too much protection for your new franchise quarterback. Radunz is an athletic and coordinated tackle prospect with good raw strength and a polished use of his hands.27. Baltimore Ravens: Trey Smith, iOL, TennesseeBaltimore has a need along the interior offensive line, and considering they like to target big-bodied blockers, the 6-foot-6, 336-pound Smith would give them a nasty brute at the guard position.28. Buffalo Bills: Jaycee Horn, CB, South CarolinaThe Bills have an incredibly talented defense, but the outside cornerback spot alongside Tre‚ÄôDavious White is a massive hole for them. Horn is an intelligent and physical defender with NFL bloodlines‚Äîhis dad is Pro Bowl wide receiver Joe Horn‚Äîand has played really well in 2020.29. Green Bay Packers: Paulson Adebo, CB, StanfordYes, the Packers skip on drafting a wide receiver in the first round again here. The value will be better in Round 2 at the position than there is here, and with Kevin King slated to hit free agency, a fluid, smart, and physical cornerback like Adebo would be a nice addition to Green Bay‚Äôs secondary.30. Kansas City Chiefs: Liam Eichenberg, OT, Notre DameEichenberg has been picking up plenty of steam as a first-round prospect since the start of the 2020 season. His intelligence, strength, and length would make him a great addition up front for the Chiefs to help protect Patrick Mahomes.31. New Orleans Saints: Mac Jones, QB, AlabamaWith how deep in cap hell the Saints are, they will likely have to create several holes on their roster in order to free up money. They could go in several different directions here, but Drew Brees is clearly near the end of his run, and Jones is an accurate thrower of the football who can read the field and hit a pretty deep ball. Even if six quarterbacks in the first round seems absurd, with the massive need at the position around the league, it‚Äôs possible.32. Pittsburgh Steelers: Chazz Surratt, LB, North CarolinaWhat do the Steelers even do here? They‚Äôre a well-rounded team who has almost everything, but they could still use an upgrade at linebacker alongside Devin Bush. There are a handful of linebackers who could be a solid choice here, but Surratt is an athletic and reliable tackler with a high motor and plenty of potential."

Subsequently, the league holds them to high regards when they considering their players for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Bears is far and above every other franchise in this category, as we can list 30 enshrined primary members, six with minor portion of their career with the Bears, and three more that aren‚Äôt listed in the franchise HOF Records (George Allen, Dick Stanfel and Sid Gillman). It's also important to note that the franchise has at least one Hall of Fame player in every position, except Wide receiver and Safety (excluding specialty positions).The fact that the Bears has so many players can act as a double edge sword, as many selectors feel more obliged to vote for players from other franchises, while the team representatives can only usually put only one name for vote per year (that especially true for the 80's stars, but more on that later).Two Bears will be enshrine in the 2020 class - Offensive tackle Jim Covert and defensive end Ed Sprinkle ‚Äì but the list of deserving players goes on and on. I divided the list to eight categories, for a better feel about their chances.Side note: The NFL weren't the only ones giving an ""All-Decade"" recognitions, and this list will include all of the ""major"" publications. Pro Football Journal also recognize a ""Mid-Decade Team"" from 1925 onwards.Legend: NFL ‚Äì NFL/HOF, SI - Sports Illustrated, SN - Sporting News, FD - Football Digest, USA ‚Äì USA Today, PFRA - Professional Football Researchers Association, PFR - Pro-Football-Reference.com, PFJ - Pro Football Journal.Next in line1. Devin Hester, KR/PR, 2006‚Äì2013
* NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team
* NFL 2000s & 2010s All-Decade Team
* 4√ó Pro Bowl (2006, 2007, 2010, 2014)
* 3√ó First-team All-Pro (2006, 2007, 2010)
* Second-team All-Pro (2011)A sure fire first ballot Hall of Famer. The best returner in the history of the game, and one of the few players that were selected to NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team before they got to Canton. We can see the Bears come back to the HOF game by 2023.What are you waiting for?1. Jay Hilgenberg, C/LS, 1981‚Äì1991
* PFJ's 1985-1995 Mid-Decade Team
* Super Bowl champion (XX)
* 7√ó Pro Bowl (1985‚Äì1991)
* 5√ó All-Pro (1986‚Äì1990)
* 2√ó All-NFC (1985, 1991)Has all the accolades to be selected, but somehow never even got to be a semi-finalist. He's no longer eligible for the regular voting, but he'll be a stronger candidate in the Senior Committee. Hilgenberg is the first player in the Top 100 greatest Bears of all-time list whiteout a HOF recognition, and the team representor in the committee, Dan Pompei, and CEO George McCaskey both mention several times that he's on the short list.2. Joe Fortunato, OLB, 1955‚Äì1966
* NFL 1950s All-Decade Team
* 1960s All-Decade 2nd. Team (PFR, PFJ)
* PFJ's 1955-1965 Mid-Decade Team
* PFRA's Hall of Very Good (2017)
* 5√ó Pro Bowl (1958, 1962‚Äì1965)
* 3√ó First-team All-Pro (1963‚Äì1965)
* 3√ó Second-team All-Pro (1958, 1962, 1966)
* NFL Champion (1963)Another player that can get in only through the Senior Committee. One of the greats in his era, but played second fiddle to the great Bill George and was forgotten by many. Fortunato got the recognition in real time, but never in the HOF ballot.* Clark Shaughnessy, Coach, 1951‚Äì1962
* 4 times finalist: 1969, 1970, 1975, 1976
* the ""father of the T formation"" and the one that cause the increasing use of the forward pass.
* Bears first Defensive Coordinator
* Help inventing the 5-3-3 and 4-3 DefensesI can't understand why he wasn't a nominee for the Centennial Class of 2020. One of the greatest inventors of the game that keep getting kicked aside by more recognizable (i.e modern) players and coaches (coaches never moving to the Senior Committee), but even on a league of ""what have you done for me lately"" he should be an exception.Maybe the Pro Football Hall of Fame should change his status to a ""Contributor"", and he'll get a better chance of getting in.Should get in1. Charles Tillman, CB, 2003‚Äì2014
* PFJ's 2005-2015 All Mid-Decade Team (HM)
* 2√ó Pro Bowl (2011, 2012)
* First-team All-Pro (2012)
* Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year (2013)
* 3√ó Brian Piccolo Award (2003, 2008, 2013)
* 44 Career Forced Fumbles
* Was known for his cover skills as well as his ability to force fumbles by stripping or ""punching"" the ball away from players (""the Peanut Punch"")Go watch the 2012 game against the Titans. I'm not talking about his greatest performance, I'm talking about the broadcast. The entire game was a ""mea culpa"" about his career, and how much he was disrespected. Tillman is also the rare breed of players that strengthening his case in retirement, when players keep preforming the ""Peanut Punch"". It going to take a while, but he will get in, this chart is all that he needs.2. Lance Briggs, OLB, 2003‚Äì2014
* 2000s All-Decade 2nd. Team (USA)
* PFJ's 2005-2015 All Mid-Decade Team (HM)
* 7√ó Pro Bowl (2005‚Äì2011)
* First-team All-Pro (2005)
* 2√ó Second-team All-Pro (2006, 2009)Like Fortunato, Briggs played in the shadow of a first ballot Hall of Famer. Unlike Fortunato he got a modern media that can back his case. We should see how he fares by the national voters in the coming years.3. Steve McMichael, DT, 1981‚Äì1993
* 1980s All-Decade 2nd. Team (PFR)
* PFJ's 1985-1995 Mid-Decade Team
* 2√ó Pro Bowl (1986, 1987)
* 2√ó First-team All-Pro (1985, 1987)
* 3√ó Second-team All-Pro (1986, 1988, 1991)
* Super Bowl champion (XX)The McMichael case is interesting one. Like Jerry Kramer he's last in line of a long list of Hall of Famers on the same team. But unlike Kramer, McMichael has the benefit of having his spiritual clone - Warren Sapp ‚Äì getting in already.4. Olin Kreutz, C, 1998‚Äì2010
* NFL 2000s All-Decade Team (2nd.)
* 6√ó Pro Bowl (2001‚Äì2006)
* First-team All-Pro (2006)
* Second-team All-Pro (2005)Kreutz is stuck behind a backlog of great OL's that trying to get in. It's not going to be easy for him, but the vast majority of modern (i.e post-merger) NFL All-Decaders get in eventually.Has a puncher's chance1. Harlon Hill, WR, 1954‚Äì1961
* NFL MVP (1955)
* PFRA's Hall of Very Good (2014)
* 1950s All-Decade Team (FD, SI)
* 3√ó Pro Bowl (1954‚Äì1956)
* 3√ó All-Pro (1954‚Äì1956)
* 2√ó NFL receiving touchdowns leader (1954, 1955)In the NBA, a MVP award is pretty much grantees that you get to the HOF, unfortunately not in football. He was GREAT in his prime, but Injuries began to take their toll on Hill's NFL career and it was essentially over when he completely severed his Achilles tendon in 1958. He was Derrick Rose before Derrick Rose, and both of them will need the stars to align perfectly to get in (Rose will probably get in, Hill not).2. Wilber Marshall, LB, 1984‚Äì1987
* PFJ's 1985-1995 Mid-Decade Team
* NFC Defensive Player of the Year (1992)
* 3√ó Pro Bowl (1986, 1987, 1992)
* 3√ó All-Pro (1986, 1991, 1992)
* NFL Alumni Linebacker of the Year (1993)
* 2√ó NFLPA NFC Linebacker of the Year (1992, 1993)
* 2√ó Super Bowl champion (XX, XXVI)One of the favorite players during the Superbowl era, which was allowed to leave for Washington. That's actually a good thing for his chances, as both team consider him one of their own, and are willing to hype him up on minute notice.3. Richie Petitbon, S, 1959‚Äì1968
* 1960s All-Decade Team (SI)
* PFJ's 1955-1965 Mid-Decade Team
* 4√ó Pro Bowl (1962, 1963, 1966, 1967)
* First-team All-Pro (1963)
* NFL champion (1963)I'm cheating here a little, because his name is keep popping up as a coach. He's arguably the best Safety in Bears history, and that's telling, but was overshadows by other greats in his era. Petitbon chances getting in are probably tying to his coaching career.(Fun fact: he's the last one of Halas's direct coaching tree to receive a head coaching job)Long shots1. Rick Casares, FB, 1955‚Äì19642. Ken Kavanaugh, WR, 1940‚Äì1941, 1945‚Äì19503. Bill Osmanski, FB, 1939‚Äì19474. Larry Morris, LB, 1959‚Äì19655. Jim McMillen, OG, 1924‚Äì1928Casares should probably be in the earlier list, but his lack of high credentials will probably kill most serious attempts. Although he was a beast in the 50's and probably one of the best (old-time) Fullbacks ever, he's probably not getting in.The other three all been on a NFL All-Decade Team, but probably belongs to the ""very good but not great"" category. McMillen is a different monster, he had a very short but amazing career (5 times First-team All-Pro) in an era without any film, so the voters can't really measure his career against other greats.Should be in, has no shot1. Joey Sternaman, QB/HB/K, 1922-25, 1927-302. Patrick Mannelly, LS, 1998‚Äì20133. ""Automatic"" Jack Manders, HB/K, 1933‚Äì19404. Joe Kopcha, OG, 1929‚Äì1935Three name on the list are pre-WWII era players that became forgettable through time. Sternaman, my personal favorite, was probably in Halas's dog house when the HOF committee selected the 1920's all decade team in retrospect (while the undeserving ""Hunk"" Anderson, Halas assistant, got in). He was chosen by others outlets, and was probably top ten player in the league first decade. Just look him up, he was AMAZING.Manders was the inventor of the Kicker position, one of the most recognized figures outside the league, and the best for a long time. He was the second NFL player on the Wheaties box (after Benny Friedman), and can be considered as the Bears MVP of the 1933 (champions) and 1934 (undefended regular season & 1st. ""Sneakers Game"") seasons - although he played with six (!) Hall of Famers.Kopcha was great by his own right and got selected to the Pro Football Illustrated All-Time Team (1947), while both he and Manders got selected to the 1930's All-Decade Team by non-NFL selectors.Mannelly is another story altogether. He's the best player in his position, but at one that wasn't exist 20 years ago. By the time they'll select a Long Snapper to the HOF, he we'll be long forgotten (no pun intended).Minor portion of career with Bears (must have's only)1. Julius Peppers, Edge2. Ruben Brown, OG3. Chuck Howley, LB4. Dick Barwegen, LB5. Jim Benton, WRPeppers is a shoo-in Hall of Famer, and I don't think I can add to that. On the other end, Brown is somehow keep getting left out from the yearly list of nominees, although his credentials are top notch and should be at least a finalist in one of those years. Someone in Buffalo needs to wake up and hype the dude.The other three are long overdue, and should hear their name from the Senior Committee. In my book Howley had to be on the Centennial Class nominees, but he'll probably get his chance on the regular route (don't forget Dallas hype machine can do wonders). Barwegen played for so many teams, therefore nobody willing to really ""vouch"" for him. Benton was great, but he played during the war years, and people hold it against him.Out of the picture completely1. Beattie Feathers, HB, 1934‚Äì37 ‚Äì 1970 Finalist2. Willie Galimore, HB, 1957‚Äì1963 ‚Äì 1992 FinalistBoth were electric players in their time, and both are Senior Committee finalists that got rejected in the final committee (rarest of the rare). Their names will never be mention again, and that's the correct decision, as both belongs to the Hall of Very Good.*All in all, I think there's five former Bears (including Peppers) that are deserving to be in the Hall of Fame as I'm writing it. Four more are on the brink of getting in, and the others are essentially on the outside looking in.This Fanpost was written by a Windy City Gridiron member, and does not necessarily reflect the ideas or opinions of its staff or community."

Their offensive play has played a major factor in that collapse, and they still saw struggles on that side of the ball before their losing streak.Chicago is among the league‚Äôs worst offensive units, placing in the bottom five in total yards per game, interceptions thrown and points per game, and they are dead last in rushing yards per game. Though they have faced several injuries to key contributors and lack in tremendous personnel, part of the blame for their struggles does lay on Nagy, whose questionable decisions regarding personnel usage, third-down play calling and timeout usage.Lazor has prior experience calling plays in the NFL, doing so as the offensive coordinator for both the Dolphins and Bengals. He was fired from both stints two years into each respective gig.While unknown exactly what differences will be made with Lazor calling the shots on offense, Nagy‚Äôs ability to admit his flaws and designate play-calling duties out of his own control is commendable. The Bears will look to aid their playoff odds with a win at home on Monday against Minnesota, who has won two straight games."

Not because they lost their starting quarterback for an undetermined amount of time, but because they never really had a starting quarterback from the start. There‚Äôs plenty of issues with this team, but more than anything, there‚Äôs too many questions without answers.1. Where do the Bears go from here because frankly, I‚Äôm not seeing a clear path moving forwardIt has reached that point in the season where the reality of another lost season is setting in. In typical Bears fashion, they are going to waste yet another top-end defense on a season where they couldn‚Äôt field a competent NFL offense.But didn‚Äôt the Bears hire an offensive minded head coach? Weren‚Äôt the days of Lovie Smith and John Fox long behind us?With every regime, it seems like a similar cycle. The defense is good and the offense just can‚Äôt do enough to consistent win games and transform them into a contender. The only time we saw a break from that was the Phil Emery era where their defense aged too quickly but even then, there was never a time when both units were good enough to make them a complete team.So what now? The easy answer for most is to hit the reset button, which includes firing both general manager Ryan Pace and head coach Matt Nagy. If they did that, they‚Äôd be going on their fifth head coach in 10 years and fourth general manager. Bad organizations stay bad because there‚Äôs no continuity. Even so, it‚Äôs hard to wonder why Pace should get another crack at fixing this roster. After all, he completely rebuilt them from the ground up and is fielding an offense that is worse than anything we saw in the John Fox era.I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs an easy answer to fixing what is broken at this point.Could Pace and Nagy go into 2021 in Lame Duck situations? Sure, but will ownership allow them to do what they need to do to fix the quarterback position? There‚Äôs just no easy answers right now and that‚Äôs extremely disheartening considering this is an organization coming out a of rebuild just three short seasons ago.2. Speaking of a clear path moving forward, let‚Äôs look more short-term and forecast who the starting quarterback is in Week 12.As most know by now, I was never a big proponent of Mitchell Trubisky starting the season as the team‚Äôs quarterback. Some will say he was technically (3-0) as the team‚Äôs starter, but I would argue that regardless of quarterback, their start was purely fools gold and one that was bound to implode at some point like we‚Äôve seen happen.Even so, Foles is getting killed out there and despite his billing as the ‚Äúcalm‚Äù and ‚Äúcollected‚Äù veteran presence behind center, he has been worse than Trubisky in terms of actual production since taking over.If it‚Äôs me and Trubisky is healthy coming out of the bye week (regardless of Foles‚Äô health situation), I make the switch back. At this point, you‚Äôve got nothing to lose. You likely can‚Äôt salvage the season, but maybe you can salvage some interest from Bears fans.3. It‚Äôs going to take a lot more than one week of Bill Lazor calling to plays to make a true impact on this offenseGoing into the game, those were my thoughts and coming out of the game, my thoughts haven‚Äôt remotely changed.Like I tweeted about on Monday morning, I wanted to be optimistic that things would drastically change, but there are core issues with this offense starting with a bad offensive line, two bad quarterbacks and most importantly, an ineffective offensive scheme that doesn‚Äôt closely resemble anything from the Andy Reid tree.Lazor‚Äôs time in Cincinnati wasn‚Äôt great by any means, but he had less than a week to prepare for this opportunity. Things take time but ultimately, I believe things are far too broken to see any sort of real change or progress before the end of this season. The Bears have a lot of work to do this upcoming off-season, but none of their failures over the next six games are something that can be held against the team‚Äôs offensive coordinator.4. It‚Äôs one thing for a team to be bad, it‚Äôs another for them to just be flat out boring to watchThat‚Äôs exactly where this team is at. Boring and frustrating to watch.I can‚Äôt be the only one who dreads having to sit through three hours of this team play some of the worst modern-era offensive football I‚Äôve seen in years. It‚Äôs not fun and frankly, it‚Äôs just not worth the time.Fans deserve better and this defense deserves far better. More than anything, it just feels like the same cycle of issues over and over again. Same issues with different faces whether that‚Äôs players, coaches or even regimes as a whole.I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one that is thankful that there are only six games left in this season. 2020 as a whole has been challenging, but the Bears have done nothing to make it much better for their viewers. Especially as of late.5. In the final six games, does winning or losing benefit this team more in the long-term?It‚Äôs still wild to think that a month ago this was a (5-1) team. Yet here we are four games later wondering to ourselves if it would actually be better for the Bears to lose games, rather than challenge for a playoff spot and ultimately fall short.Here‚Äôs my take- Middling is the last thing the Bears can afford to do right now. Maybe they make a switch at quarterback, get healthy and finish (10-6) to get into the playoffs. From there, the outlook would be more promising and maybe we are back in the camp of signing a veteran like Dak Prescott and fixing the offensive line as a short-term option for contention.More than likely, this is a team that will be lucky to win more than eight games and at this point, it‚Äôs hard to see how they win much more than a game or two down the stretch. In my opinion, finish (8-8) is about the worst thing they can do. Either be bad enough to land a high draft pick or be good enough to give fans hope that with a few bold off-season moves, this team will be back in the playoff mix next year.Either way, I‚Äôm just hoping this team leaves no doubt in which direction they should head in the coming months when looking toward the off-season.6. If the season ended today...The Bears would be picking 16th overall in the 2021 NFL draft. That‚Äôs not likely good enough to get into the mix for a top-end quarterback without having to trade up, but it‚Äôs much better than sitting in the low 20‚Äôs.We‚Äôll see how things play out over the next two weeks, but it‚Äôs very possible that heading into Week 13, the Bears could be sitting in a position where they‚Äôll be in the Top 12.Again, at this point, leave no doubt as to which direction this team should head during the off-season.7. Has there been a more positive development than Roquan Smith this season on either side of the ball?I said it last week and I‚Äôll say it again ‚Äî Smith is playing like an All-Pro. He added another 14 total tackles, three tackles for loss and a sack on Monday night to his season total. He‚Äôs currently tied for the most tackles in the league with 96 and is playing out of his mind on a weekly basis.This was exactly what the Bears had in mind when they took him No. 8 overall. More importantly, this was exactly the type of play that the team needed when trying to justify the positional value of taking an off-the-ball linebacker within the top 10 of the 2018 draft.8. For as much as the team invested within it‚Äôs pass rush, they aren‚Äôt getting nearly the amount of production anyone had hoped for.$49.5 million-per-year. That‚Äôs how much the Bears are paying the combination of Khalil Mack, Akiem Hicks and Robert Quinn on a yearly average to get after the quarterback. Despite that, the Bears are averaging just 2.1 sacks-per-game and are not pressuring any quarterback consistently.Mack has more than done his job, as has Hicks for the most part, but when the team cut ties with Leonard Floyd this off-season and signed the 30-year-old veteran in Quinn, they had much more in mind then him playing under 60% of the total defensive snaps and a single sack.As the team gets tighter against the cap and the offense continues to trend in the wrong direction, the focus on poor investments like Quinn will loom large. Oh and by the way, Leonard Floyd has seven sacks on the season...9. Once Jason Spriggs and/or Bobby Massie returns, the Bears need to get Rashaad Coward out of the lineupInjuries happen and I get that. Quality depth along the offensive line is hard to come by, but that‚Äôs also what happens when you refuse to draft meaningful depth or sign veterans that can at least look like a starting caliber player if called upon.That‚Äôs where the Bears are at, especially on their interior. My guess would be that once Sam Mustipher is ready to go, he‚Äôll get a chance to see some time at center, which would mean swinging Cody Whitehair back out to guard. Either way, Coward‚Äôs run as a starter needs to end and this off-season, him being on this roster should come to an end as well. It was a fun story while it lasted with him coming in as an undrafted free agent and switching over to the other side of the ball, but it hasn‚Äôt worked out.How the team will choose to form it‚Äôs starting five once players return from injuries will be interesting, but at this point it doesn‚Äôt look promising regardless.10. I‚Äôll leave you with one more positive...While Smith may be the most pleasant surprise and needed development on this team, Cairo Santos‚Äô emergence as a not only a reliable, but damn-good kicker has been something that could pay off for this team down the line.It will be interesting to see how they handle his contract situation this off-season, but my guess is that if he finishes out the season strong, he‚Äôll get a short-term deal to stay in Chicago. Considering what he‚Äôs been through since 2016, it‚Äôs pretty remarkable that the 29-year-old has hung around and will likely go into Week 1 of the 2021 season as the team‚Äôs unquestioned starting kicker."

Initial tests showed no fracture in his hip. He'll undergo further evaluation. pic.twitter.com/LmKR6uiYitThe Bears have a bye coming up this week, which will give them extra time for Foles to heal up, but also for Mitchell Trubisky to get his throwing shoulder right. Trubisky hasn‚Äôt been active since injuring himself in the one play he ran on November 1, in their loss to the New Orleans Saints.The last time Trubisky hurt his shoulder he missed two weeks, so if this timetable is similar to that one, he should be good to go for their next game on November 29 against the Green Bay Packers.If neither Foles nor Trubisky can play by then, it‚Äôll be Tyler Bray and Kyle Sloter manning the quarterback position.UPDATE: In other injury news, head coach Matt Nagy confirmed that Akiem Hicks has a right hamstring strain, and that punt returner Dwayne Harris may have a torn tricep, which would land him on season ending injured reserve. He also confirmed that the injury to Foles isn‚Äôt as bad as they feared and he‚Äôs calling it a hip/glute injury."

Let‚Äôs ask Optimistic Bear, Realistic Bear, and Pessimistic Bear where this puts the Bears in the NFL power rankings, plus we‚Äôll pick one player from each team we would love on the Bears.After losing a third straight contest, this time to the Tennessee Titans, the Bears are searching for answers. The Bears are home underdogs, making this their 8th consecutive game where the opponent is favored to win. The record stands at 5-4, but this team needs to turn things around if they want to contend for a playoff spot in a tough NFC race.Elsewhere in the NFL, the Steelers stayed undefeated, the Bills beat the Seahawks to stake their claim as a Super Bowl contender, and the Patriots beat the Jets in a Monday Night Football game. That last one was more fun than the teams‚Äô combined 2 (now 3) wins would suggest it should have been.To place the Bears in their proper place in this week‚Äôs power rankings, we‚Äôll call upon our friends Optimistic Bear, Pessimistic Bear, and Realistic Bear:Optimistic Bear (Patti): This Bears ranking is too hot.Pessimistic Bear (Jack): This Bears ranking is too cold.Realistic Bear (Jeff): This Bears ranking is just right.We‚Äôll average the combined rankings for the Bears and fit them into our list of the rest of the NFL, providing reasons why we believe the Bears deserve to be ranked accordingly. If the Chicago climbs to #1 on Sunday, February 7, 2021 you can go back and read through the rise and fall of your beloved Bears through these power rankings.We‚Äôll pair these rankings with a player from each team we would love to see in the Navy and Orange. Salary cap be damned, a team with a few of these players would be fun to watch at Solider Field!32. New York Jets (0-9, LW 32): WR Jamison Crowder. Excellent route runner with a high motor opposite Allen Robinson? Yes please.31. Jacksonville Jaguars (1-7, LW 31): C Brandon Linder. Usually ranked in the top-5 at his position, he‚Äôs under-the-radar because of the team he plays for.30. Washington Football Team (2-6, LW 26): WR Terry McLaurin. Top-15 fantasy WR because he regularly threatens 100+ receiving yards.29. New England Patriots (3-5, LW 27): S Devin McCourty. Pair him with Eddie Jackson and it‚Äôs over for teams trying to throw the ball.28. New York Giants (2-7, LW, 30): RB Saquon Barkley. Stability at the running back position? Wouldn‚Äôt that be something.27. Dallas Cowboys (2-7, LW 29): QB Dak Prescott. Unlike some others, I don‚Äôt actually think Prescott is in the cards for the Bears this offseason. I love quarterbacks who outperform their draft position, though.26. Houston Texans (2-6, LW 28): LT Laremy Tunsil. I still can‚Äôt believe the Dolphins ever traded him.25. Los Angeles Chargers (2-6, LW 25): DE Joey Bosa. Very disruptive in the pass rush. Even if he doesn‚Äôt get home, he affects the play.24. Denver Broncos (3-5, LW 23): LB Von Miller. Excellent leader on and off the field.23. Detroit Lions (3-5, LW 24): QB Matthew Stafford. His loyalty to the Lions is admirable. I‚Äôve always wondered what he would look like with a solid team around him. We may never know.22. San Francisco 49ers (4-5, LW 18): CB Richard Sherman. He‚Äôs very good at getting in the heads of receivers without committing stupid penalties.21. Carolina Panthers (3-6, LW 22): RB Christian McCaffrey. There are a few Panthers who would be great fits in Chicago, but we can‚Äôt miss the layup and say we wouldn‚Äôt want the best non-quarterback in the NFL to be on the Bears.20. Atlanta Falcons (3-6, LW 21): C Alex Mack. Perennial pro bowler with little to no injury concerns.19. Minnesota Vikings (3-5, LW 20): WR Adam Thielen. He has all the traits and he doesn‚Äôt take plays off.18. Philadelphia Eagles (3-4-1, LW 19): WR Alshon Jeffery. Miss you, bud.17. Chicago Bears (5-4, LW 12):Optimistic Bear: I‚Äôm not blind. I can see the Bears are struggling on the offensive line and that‚Äôs limiting their offensive mobility. But the defense is starting to settle in to mid season form, and even the near-bear strength of Derrick Henry wasn‚Äôt able to run through them. I‚Äôll give them a dip to be fair given their three game losing streak is likely to have an effect on morale, so I‚Äôll place them right behind the unsuspecting Packers... ready to pounce.Pessimistic Bear: There are four teams with worse losing streaks than the Bears current 3-game skid: the Jets (9), the Jaguars (7), the Cowboys (4), and the Panthers (4). The Panthers actually have an offense, and just took the Chiefs to the wire in Kansas City. Therefore put the Bears at 26, just above the Cowboys. The two of them can have a bidding war for Uncle Rico at quarterback.Realistic Bear: Hello, Darkness, my old friend. I‚Äôm not sure why some fans thought that Titans game would be anything less than a disaster with a depleted offensive line and no real QB talent on the roster. I still like the defense, hard to rank them below the Eagles but starting to envy the Bengals, which is a crazy place to be.16. Cincinnati Bengals (2-5-1, LW 16): QB Joe Burrow. You know who doesn‚Äôt have a great offensive line? The Bengals. You know how they make up for it? Great quarterback play.15. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-3, LW 8): WR Mike Evans. Such a deep threat. One on one down the sideline, you lose.14. Cleveland Browns (5-3, LW 15): CB Denzel Ward. The Bears aren‚Äôt exactly hurting at corner right now, but Ward is still a lot of fun to watch. Locks it down.13. Los Angeles Rams (5-3, LW 14): DT Aaron Donald. Another layup. Best defensive player in the league.12. Indianapolis Colts (5-3, LW 7): LG Quenton Nelson. Well-balanced. Disciplined. Has all the traits. Just a rock solid offensive lineman.11. Las Vegas Raiders (5-3, LW 13): QB Derek Carr. He‚Äôs a cold-killer, man.10. Arizona Cardinals (5-3, LW 5): QB Kyler Murray. Dual-threat quarterback with an outstanding ability to read NFL defenses. He‚Äôs only 23 years old.9. Miami Dolphins (5-3, LW 17): CB Xavien Howard. Interception machine. He would fit in so well with Kyle Fuller and Eddie Jackson.8. Tennessee Titans (6-2, LW 11): RB Derrick Henry. A good way of covering quarterback deficiencies is pounding the rock. Henry is probably the best rock-pounder in the league.7. Seattle Seahawks (6-2, LW 6): SS Jamal Adams. I know I mentioned not missing layups, and I understand Wilson is there and a top contender for MVP. Adams is just one of those defenders who is always in on the play. It looks like there‚Äôs two of him out there.6. Green Bay Packers (6-2, LW 10): QB Aaron Rodgers. There‚Äôs the layup.5. Buffalo Bills (7-2, LW 9): DT Ed Oliver. Pair him with Akiem Hicks and Eddie Goldman and this defensive line becomes lethal.4. Baltimore Ravens (6-2, LW 4): LT Ronnie Stanley. Huge bummer about his season-ending injury. He‚Äôs arguably the best offensive lineman in football, and was essential to Lamar‚Äôs MVP season last year.3. New Orleans Saints (6-2, LW 3): RB Alvin Kamara. He was selected with a draft pick that the Bears traded away. In another reality...2. Kansas City Chiefs (8-1, LW 2): TE Travis Kelce. Put the best tight end in the league on the Bears and watch a lot of quarterback issues disappear.1. Pittsburgh Steelers (8-0, LW 1): OLB TJ Watt. He might be second only to Aaron Donald for best defensive player in the league. Opposing signal-callers have to account for him on every play. He‚Äôs at the center of the Steelers defensive resurgence and will be a force for years to come."

Whether it be Anthony Miller shaking off the ups and downs that have been his career to date to finally be consistent, Darnell Mooney burning the Vikings secondary, Allen Robinson taking over a game, or figuring out how to get Ryan Nall more swing passes (reaching here, I know), hopefully Lazor‚Äôs playcalling opens something up that Nagy‚Äôs did not.Onwards to 6-4, tomorrow night. Bear Down, my friends.The WCG Sunday Livestream is a solo show today, what with the game being tomorrow and all, but weeknight games throw us all off and between the bye and the Thanksgiving weekend, we didn‚Äôt want to risk three weeks with nothing, so here we are.Besides, it‚Äôs not a bad thing for us to just catch up together.We‚Äôll talk about the playcalling switch, what it means, if it means anything, and who might benefit from Lazor at the mic. We‚Äôll also give appropriate kudos to the defense as we always do.Of course, all the usual ways to get a hold of us exist.As usual, we‚Äôll see you at 9:30 AM CT."

He was the very essence of a team player ‚Äì quiet, unassuming and always ready to compliment a teammate for a key block. Gale was an extraordinary man who overcame a great deal of adversity during his NFL career and life.The ‚ÄúKansas Comet‚Äù burst onto the scene in the National Football League and captured the attention of all of America. Despite playing only 68 NFL games because of an injury-shortened career, Gale was a clear-cut ‚Äî and first-ballot ‚Äî Hall of Famer for his accomplishments on the field and for the man of character he was in life.The entire Pro Football Hall of Fame family mourns the passing of Gale. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Ardie, and their entire family. We will forever keep his legacy alive to serve as inspiration for future generations. The Hall of Fame flag will fly at half-staff until he is laid to rest.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs the statement on Sayers‚Äô passing from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.The NFL family lost a true friend today with the passing of Gale Sayers. Gale was one of the finest men in NFL history and one of the game‚Äôs most exciting players.Gale was an electrifying and elusive runner who thrilled fans every time he touched the ball. He earned his place as a first-ballot Hall of Famer.We will also forever remember Gale for his inspiration and kindness. Gale‚Äôs quiet unassuming demeanor belied his determination, competitiveness and compassion.We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife Ardie, and their family. Our thoughts are with his teammates, the Bears organization, the many fans who remember him as a football player and the many more people who were touched by Gale‚Äôs spirit and generosity.Bears Chairman George H. McCaskey issued this statement.Football fans know well Gale‚Äôs many accomplishments on the field: a rare combination of speed and power as the game‚Äôs most electrifying runner, a dangerous kick returner, his comeback from a serious knee injury to lead the league in rushing, and becoming the youngest player inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. People who weren‚Äôt even football fans came to know Gale through the TV movie ‚ÄòBrian‚Äôs Song,‚Äô about his friendship with teammate Brian Piccolo. Fifty years later, the movie‚Äôs message that brotherhood and love needn‚Äôt be defined by skin color, still resonates.Coach [George] Halas said it best, when presenting Gale for induction at the Hall of Fame: ‚ÄòHis like will never be seen again.‚ÄôOn behalf of the McCaskey family, we offer our sincerest condolences to [his wife] Ardie and the entire Sayers family."

However, things are not as bad they seem in the NFC North, as I had Packers 6-1 right now but Vikings actually did us a favour by beaten them at weekend in a surprise result. Lions are pretty much the Lions I expected them to be and are 3-4 like I predicted but look out, Lions might make some noise in next block.Next Block of 4 (3rd)First thing, this block of 4 games extends over 5 weeks due to our bye week, which is week 11. So all other NFC North teams have 5 games in this block.I always felt that the second block-of-4 was the toughest block for us this season but fair to say the next block-of-4 is the most important block of season, as we have 3 divisional games.We need one more 3-1 block to reach playoffs for sure, I'm quite concerned about our run defence in this block, we have Henry, Cook, Jones over next 3 games but do think we beat Vikings and Lions, think we lose to Titans but do like our chances against Packers, who am not convinced there as good as people think they are, after all, they just lost to the Vikings.Bears: Titans(L), Vikings (W), Packers (W), Lions (W)Divisional RivalsPackers: 49ers(L), Jaguars (W), Colts (L), Bears(L), Eagles(W)Lions: Vikings (W), Washington (W), Panthers (W), Texans (W), Bears (L)Vikings: Lions (L), Bears (L), Cowboys (W), Panthers (L), Jaguars (W)I always had 49ers beaten Packers but Jimmy G + Kittle are injured now, so not so sure Packers lose this Thursday, Packers probably should win this one now but they did just get run over by Cook and 49ers do have good RB's.Looking at our divisional rivals schedule, it's actually a bit concerning as there not a lot of teams that I'm 100% sure will beat Packers and Lions, so we MUST take care of business in our divisional games, which goes to my point earlier, the next block of 4 is most important block of season.Vikings just beat Packers and do have Cooks back now, they go as far as he goes, so Vikings might beat Lions and Panthers might beat Lions as well. Also, Lions are going be super motivated against us after week 1 game and I have them coming into our game on a 4-game winning streak, let's hope I'm wrong and its a L,W,L,W before our game with Lions.Texans, Jaguars and the NFC East teams are just bad teams this season and going be an easy win for most. Hopefully some surprise loses happen here as you can see below how tight things could be after this block of games.NFC North Divisional Rankings after week 13Fourth block of 4 early thoughtsActually really like our chances in this block a lot, we have Texans, Vikings, Jaguars and Packers.Packers and Lions actually have a tougher end of season, Packers have Lions, Titans, Panthers and us. Lions have Packers, Bucs, Titans, Vikings.Even if we did lose to Titans and Packers in block 3, I think there enough in block 4 for us to still win the NFC North but it could come down to the final week of the season,Past Block of 4 articlesFirst block of 4 reviewSeason PreviewThis Fanpost was written by a Windy City Gridiron member, and does not necessarily reflect the ideas or opinions of its staff or community."

Montgomery is still in concussion protocol after taking a hit in last weeks game.Center Sam Mustipher, who hasn‚Äôt practiced all week with a knee injury, is listed as doubtful.Offensive tackle Jason Spriggs, who missed practice earlier his week with a knee injury but was limited today, is one of four Bears listed as questionable. The other three questionable Bears are tight end Cole Kmet (groin), who had the same practice schedule as Spriggs this week, and outside linebacker Barkevious Mingo (shoulder) and wide out Allen Robinson (knee), who each practiced in a limited capacity all week.Center Cody Whitehair, who is on the Reserve/COVID-19 list, could be activated in time for Monday‚Äôs game according to head coach Matt Nagy.I would expect the Bears to make a few roster moves in the next couple days as they still only have 51 players on their 53-man roster (55 allowed for game day). Whitehair would fill one spot if activated, but a few practice squad players could come up as well with running back Lamar Miller, defensive lineman Daniel McCullers, and quarterback Tyler Bray being likely candidates.The injury report from the Vikings looks like this.Tight end Irv Smith Jr. is out and cornerback Cameron Dantzler is questionable with a concussion.That‚Äôs it, but for those that don‚Äôt follow the Vikes that closely, they have a few key players on injured reserve, most notably linebacker Anthony Barr, defensive end Danielle Hunter, and corners Holton Hill and Mike Hughes.EDIT: The Vikings placed offensive lineman Dru Samia, who has 4 starts this year, on the Reserve/COVID-19 list."
579,bears,https://www.windycitygridiron.com/2020/7/10/21319743/comparing-three-winning-seasons,Comparing Three Winning Seasons,"Chicago Bears Schedule, News, Roster and Stats | Windy City GridironBy stepeo on Jul 10, 2020, 11:31am CDT 14This Fanpost was written by a Windy City Gridiron member, and does not necessarily reflect the ideas or opinions of its staff or community.Three seasons and their comparisonsThe seasons are from different Head Coaches and a close win loss season from each.I was going to start with the oldest season 2001, and Dick Jauron, then next one was Lovie Smith and 2006 season, then Matt Nagy's first season as Head Coach.THE SUPER BEARS 2006 (I have The Book)I am going to start with Lovie Smith. Lovie, when he gave his opening speech to the media, said he had three goals to achieve with The Chicago Bears. One to beat The Pack, two to win The Division and three win a Super Bowl and they do manage to get to the The Big Game. All the pundits had them going 12-5, or 13-4, and even 14-3. What, with this Defence, your kidding me, could we go undefeated, yes we could. We drafted Daniel Manning, Devin Hester (record TD returns) D. Dvoracek, J Williams, M Anderson ( 12 sacks in 1 game), JD Runnels and T Reed, this year. Opening game was the same as our last two seasons (2018/19), and at Lambeau Field. The first shut out ever for Packers with Favre at QB. What a great start to this season, also games like The Monday Night Miracle, 24-23. All scores are from Defence and special teams. Coming back from a 20-0 halftime score, and taking the lead for the first time late in the fourth, we win 24-23. Quite a few games are large scoring wins, and another shutout at The Giants 10-0. We finish season 14-3, and off to the play offs.There is one thing I am not happy with though, it is the loss to Green Bay in the last scheduled game at home 26-7, WHAT.Now the happiest thing is drafting Devon Hester, and Mark Anderson (12 sacks in 1 game). This team is in the top Defences of The Bears Franchise, special teams are also up there with the best we ever had. This roster is filled with so much talent, like the game changers, Devon Hester (rookie), Charles Tillman, Brian Urlacher, Olin Kreutz, Patrick Mannelly, 6 Pro Bowl Players picked from this squad.The Double Doink SeasonNow we look at Matt Nagy's 2018 season, BE YOU wasn't it?, he was making an impact before training starts. After the John Fox short era, we end up with a not quite seasoned coach. He is brand new from the box, and we get to play our number 1 pick, 1 season old, QB Mitch Trubisky. No really stand out game changer on the offence, maybe Cohen, maybe.Our defence is loaded, we have really stepped out and grabbed FA Khalil Mack from The Raiders, we have the most costly LB on anyone's roster. We need to make it pay, and have some really good talent around him, including rookie, Roquan Smith, another LB. We have been known to have some of the really best linebackers, in NFL history, and that's another post.Our opening game is against The Green Bay team, and this isn't a happy feeling, or start, losing 23-24. Then we go on to win the next 3 games. Our next two games are The Dolphins at Miami, and New England, both losses. Then we go on to have a 5 game winning streak, then a game that should have been won, Giants. Who had been really playing bad, they go on to win against our back up QB Chase Daniel , due to Mitch Trubisky's injury. I think, if we had won this game, it would have effected the end of season results, we could have made the play offs with a bye week. DOH!Again, so close yet so far. Even with the amount of talent, especially on Defence. I think this is something we need to address. We do not have any, really game changers on Offence, Tarik Cohen I think can be that player, with schemes/trick plays built around him. Jordan Howard ,now he is the running back who won't be on the team next season, as according to Matt Nagy, he doesn't fit the scheme !! Being particular on a players capabilities could be the achilie's heel on his scheme of things. 3 seasons of Howard combined is 3370 yards rushing with 24 TD's, then receiving 568, 1 TD.!! What more could we ask for? Our kicker was really our weakest link!The green on The Eagles uniform is like Kryptonite to our Super Bears.2001 SEASON.... The Team Of Destiny... (5 comeback from behind wins)It's weird the way they picked Dick Jauron as Head Coach, he wasn't the guy they wanted. Prior to his selection, The Chicago franchise had chosen, Dave McGinnis according to the media.. He was upset, as everyone was informed, and he hadn't agreed anything. DOH!""Skeletor"" was the fans nickname for Dick. He had Mark Hatley GM drafting, and in 1998, Dick's first season they picked Brian Urlacher, first round, as a safety though he is in Canton now as, Inside Linebacker. What a pick, I believe Steelers where after him, but after some consideration, they went for Plaxico Burress, Wide Receiver. Chicago got their man, who would lead them for 13 years. Players drafted in this season, 2001, are, David Terrell WR, Anthony Thomas (R.O.Y.) RB, Mike Gandy OL. Well we also have to look at the guy's who made The Pro Bowl, O Line,James Williams, and LDT Ted Washington , (a FA from The Bills),. 2018 R.O.Y. Urlacher. Then, our centre, Olin Kreutz, also ST Larry Whigham, this year. They have Mike Brown at Free Safety, who has back to back, winning Touch Downs in overtime. First game against The Niners, then next against The Browns. Holy Cow, you couldn't predict it. These two games plus another three games are ALL comeback games they win. Three losses, the first is the opening game of the season against The Super Bowl Champions from the previous season, The Baltimore Ravens 6-17, and what, I cannot explain,we are white washed by Green Bay. It's this that I feel, if you can build a team to beat them, you will win the division, no question. Maybe,this is our Kryptonite, the green on their uniforms. Anthony Thomas #35 is the guy we have that eats up the clock, with 278 attempts, 1183 yards and 7 touch downs get's Offensive Rookie Of The Year, (Urlacher was also R.O.Y last season). This team is bubbling with really a balanced O and D with a very good talented Special Team. Again we play The Philadelphia Eagles and again, it's Kryptonite, to our Super Chicago Bears.We are sooo! unlucky when we get to face them. But It this Bears Squad, out of the 3, that I feel, where unlucky not to get further. It's a really good squad, with a very likeable Quarter Back Jim Miller! I like the man, but don't think we would get any further with him. So I wouldn't pick this squad. After going over these 3 games, I have come to the conclussion that if Mark Hatley was picking players in the draft, with Nagy as OC and Smith as Head Coach, we would always be in contention. Also, we need to have the talent to beat The teams in green.

608,bears,https://www.windycitygridiron.com/21452363/gale-sayers-dick-butkus-inspired-me-to-become-a-chicago-bears-fan-1968,Gale Sayers & Dick Butkus inspired me to become a Chicago Bears fan,"FILED UNDER:On this sad day when we have lost the greatest pure runner to have graced the gridiron, here‚Äôs the story about how he inspired meLike the rest of Bears Nation, I was deeply saddened today to hear of the loss of the greatest pure runner ever to have played the game, Gale Sayers.Sayers was one of my football idols, and as I will explain below he‚Äôs largely the reason that I became a life-long Chicago Bears fan. This is my story, and the story about how watching an amazing athlete can affect a person‚Äôs entire life.When looking back to teams of the 1960‚Äôs, there are very few players that you see that would be slam-dunk all-pro‚Äôs if they walked onto today‚Äôs playing fields in their prime, but that Bears team had two of them, Sayers and Dick Butkus.Although I never got to see them in person, I was able to see them on television (which I finally got access to in 1970) while still in their primes. As a kid living in the Orient, I was raised on radio. We didn‚Äôt have a TV until 1969, purchased so we could watch the Apollo Landings (all of the stations where we lived were in Japanese which none of us spoke very well), and it wasn‚Äôt until we moved to Okinawa that we had an American language station.All of this means that I became a Bears fan by listening to game-rebroadcasts on the radio. (To this day, I prefer to listen to the radio broadcast live and I don‚Äôt watch Bears games on TV as they are being played).When listening on the radio, you see things in your mind, and with Gale Sayers I think he‚Äôs the only football athlete I can remember where the vision of him in my mind wasn‚Äôt as impressive as seeing his actual exploits. The only other athlete I can think of that is like this is Michael Jordan in his prime.Back in 2017, I wrote the following for an article about how I, a boy not from Chicago or Illinois and living half way around the world, became a Bears fan.I thought it appropriate to re-share it today, in honor of Mr. Sayers.I became a Bears fan one night in November, 1968.I‚Äôm not sure what day exactly, but it was a school night. I was in Miss Inoye‚Äôs class at Tachikawa‚Äôs grade school annex on Tachikawa Air Force Base on the Kanto plains in Japan.My father was away with his team of fellow McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom factory engineers in DaNang, Vietnam on one of his several six-months tours of service, so it was just the four of us, my mom and two older sisters in the house at supper time.Both of my sisters left with neighborhood friends after dinner (6:00 PM sharp, every day) and mom settled in for a night of reading, which meant for once I got to choose which radio station we listened to.Not that there were a lot of choices. There were MANY radio stations in the Kanto area on the outskirts of Tokyo, but very few of them were in English. At that time, there was no English language television whatever in Japan, so we didn‚Äôt even have a TV set.I tuned in to the scratchy barely-in-range American language radio broadcast (probably AFN radio in Yokohama but it could have been a shortwave station or even a wildcatter) for the evening‚Äôs programming, which turned out to be a rebroadcast of the November 3 football game between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers.I‚Äôd never actually seen a football game live, so I had to imagine what was going by listening to the descriptions of the announcers‚Ä¶ who talked of giant armored men battling it out in the trenches (I did know what trenches were, it seemed a bit confusing because I had seen football fields and I never saw a single one of them with trenches).As I listened, there was this player named Gale Sayers who seemed to be running past, around and through everybody in sight. Every time he touched the ball, he seemed to break off runs for huge yardage. The announcers were excitedly talking about him breaking an all time team record for rushing yardage, but near the end of the game they were shocked when he fumbled the ball and it put the Bears in terrible trouble.Going into the game, I knew that my father liked the Bears and rooted for them casually, but I personally didn‚Äôt care one way or the other... but as Sayers gained yard after yard, I started pulling for him and the Bears more and more.My firm bedtime was 9:00, and I fully expected that when it hit the game would be turned off‚Ä¶ so I kept hoping that my mom would not be watching the clock. I looked out of the sides of my eyes and I could see that she was getting caught up in the game as well.At 9:00 sharp she told me it was time to get ready for bed, and I knew better to argue‚Ä¶ one didn‚Äôt argue with my parents, or whine (therein laid the road to perdition), so I got ready for bed while leaving the radio on‚Ä¶It got down towards the final two minutes of the game, and my mother motioned me over to the couch to sit next to her. It was a 10-10 tie and it looked like that‚Äôs how the game would end (there was no overtime back then).The Packers punted to Chicago, and the Chicago returner fair-caught the ball on the Packers 43-yard line.Up until then I had been following along pretty well, as I had listened to other football games before, but something was going on that was turning both the game and the announcing of it into pure chaos.I gotta admit, it got really baffling to listen to.It was apparent by the radio call‚Äôs descriptions that the players on both teams were perplexed about what was happening on the field as well.With 23-seconds left on the clock, the Bears somehow (seemingly randomly) went out and kicked the ball through the uprights to win the game.To me, it didn‚Äôt matter. The Bears who I was rooting for had won, and the Packers had lost. I gotta be honest, that‚Äôs something that hasn‚Äôt changed with me since 1968... Bears beating Packers is good, every single time.I now know (unlike when I listened to it via taped delay) that the November 3, 1968 game was one of the most famous games in Bears history. Gale Sayers ran for 205 yards (his all-time best and a week before his first serious knee injury).Bears kicker Mac Percival converted an extremely rare ‚Äúfree kick‚Äù from the 43-yard line after offensive line coach Abe Gilbron talked head coach Jim Dooley into giving it a try. Back in the 1960‚Äôs in the NFL, the goal posts were on the goal line, making the field effectively 20-yards shorter in the kicking game (10-yards on each end).Here‚Äôs some more information about that game:Most Bears fans know all about their team‚Äôs 73-0 rout of the Redskins in the 1940 NFL title game, Gale Sayers‚Äô six-touchdown performance against the 49ers in 1965 and the exploits of the 1985 Super Bowl champions... but the ‚ÄúFree Kick‚Äù game also stands out in team history.Chicago won the game 13-10. With that one game, the Bears had turned a young boy in military family housing half-way around the world into a life long fan.That‚Äôs how I became a fan of the Chicago Bears.How did YOU become a fan of the Bears? Were there any special games in your early Bears fandom you would like to share?Ken‚Äôs Note: As Homer Hickam put it in his wonderful memoir about his parents and an alligator, ‚ÄúCarrying Albert Home‚Äù, this is a ‚Äúsomewhat true‚Äù story based entirely upon the remembrance of my six-year-old self. There was a game, there was a radio broadcast, and the happenings described on the field are factual. The rest is as I remember it 50 years later from the depths of the mind of a former first grader."

It was a good news-bad news situation.This reflects the contradictory situation that Dallas is in. The team would obviously like to win some games to give them something to build on for next season, but they come out of the week still with a firm grip on the third overall pick in the NFL draft, and obviously winning would probably serve to move them down.Everything stems from the standings in the division. If you are squeamish, you may want to look away.Yeah, that‚Äôs ugly. The Football Team holds the tiebreaker over the Cowboys at the moment. The Houston Texans, also 2-7, are behind Dallas in the draft order as well. For a while, there was a chance that the Cowboys could move up to number two for now, but the Jacksonville Jaguars fell just short in their upset bid against the Green Bay Packers.Here are the two games involving the rest of the NFCE, and what the outcomes meant.It was a game where the Giants, who could have dropped into a tie in the win column with Dallas and Washington, pretty much were in control the entire way. Daniel Jones outplayed Carson Wentz. When the Eagles drew within three points on the opening drive of the third quarter, the Giants responded with a six-play, 75 yard TD drive to push the margin back to ten. The Eagles would score another TD to cut it to four, missing a two-point conversion, but New York got a couple of fourth quarter field goals to hold them at bay.Given what happened with the Football Team, Wentz now is probably no better than the third-best starting QB, depending on how you view Andy Dalton. Or Garrett Gilbert, if Dalton is not able to go against the Minnesota Vikings. Heck, Wentz may just be number five out of four teams. (I will refrain from the Jalen Hurts jokes, because the Eagles seem committed to only using him as a wildcat type player, which so far has been a dismal flop.)As for Jones, he is probably number two, because of what happened in the other game involving a division rival.The Fighting Teams almost pulled out a win against the Lions, who should probably be honorary members of the East. They tied the game with just 16 seconds to go before somehow allowing the Lions to get in position for a 59-yard game winner from Matt Prater.But the story of the game was likely comeback player of the year Alex Smith, in his first start since his gruesome and life-threatening injury. He put up a stat line of 38 completions on a staggering 55 attempts, for 390 yards. An inability to get more points than they did doomed the Team, but it was a remarkable effort from Smith. He still is living off of short passes, but that is a solid day‚Äôs work for anyone.So now the Cowboys are in a very strange position. Win only a handful of their remaining seven games, and they could be atop the division. Or just eke out one or two, and likely be in possession of a top five draft slot. And incredibly, the same can be said about all of the members of the worst division in football.Depending on how you really want the season to go, the rest of the schedule is not exactly intimidating for Dallas. They face all three of their division rivals once more, plus three more sub-.500 teams in the Vikings, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the San Francisco 49ers (pending the outcome of the late games.) The only remaining playoff caliber team on the schedule are the 6-2 Baltimore Ravens.A lot depends on how the quarterback situation works out, but with the defense showing a lot more the past two games and the offensive line at least starting to find some rhythm, the Cowboys are somehow still a threat to win the East and go to the playoffs. That would not likely go very well, but it would inject a ton of confidence in the players. It would also build a lot of faith in the coaching staff, something that was in very short supply not too long ago.But it would surely be nice to have that good draft position. If you are feeling mixed emotions about what you want to see happen, it is completely understandable."

What player makes PFF‚Äôs All-Rookie Team?,"FILED UNDER:Here is your Sunday edition of Cowboys news...Former NFL scout Daniel Jeremiah ranks his top 25 rookies at the season‚Äôs midway point, and a couple Cowboys make this list.Lamb can play inside and outside. He‚Äôs shown tremendous concentration and toughness to work in traffic.Diggs has given up some plays, but his ball skills have been tremendous. Unfortunately, he suffered an injury in Week 9 and might miss the rest of the season.Only one Cowboys draft pick made PFF‚Äôs All-Rookie Team, and it‚Äôs probably not the guy you‚Äôd think it would be.C TYLER BIADASZ, DALLAS COWBOYSThere have only been two starting centers in this rookie class, and Biadasz has been the better of the two. However, that‚Äôs not saying much, as he‚Äôs only earned a 53.3 overall grade and allowed multiple pressures in three of his six starts.The emergence of Lamb shakes up the Cowboys wide receiver group. Former BTB alum K.D. Drummond takes a detailed look at the Cooper situation and explains why the team should considering dealing him.Cooper‚Äôs Contract Structured the Right WayThe Cowboys took care of business when they inked Cooper to a five-year extension worth $100 million this offseason. It was the exact amount I forecasted it would take to sign him. Better than the numbers being right on point with his value, was that the Cowboys made the deal in a way that they aren‚Äôt married to Cooper in the same way they have been to other star players.Dallas knew there would be a decision coming after 2021 whether or not they wanted to re-sign Michael Gallup. Cooper‚Äôs deal has an easy out clause after 2021 because they barely gave him any signing bonus.Cooper got $10 million in base salary in Year 1, and a $10 million signing bonus. That cap hit from that bonus is spread out evenly over five years. His cap hit in 2020 was just $12 million even though he made $20 million.He‚Äôs scheduled to make $20 million in salary each of the next four years, so he‚Äôll have a $22 million cap hit each year.If Dallas were to trade him, they‚Äôd get rid of the $20 million base salary, keep the $2 million prorated bonus for 2021, and then they‚Äôd have to eat $6 million more in bonus allocation ($2 million each from 2022, 2023, and 2024), for a total of $8 million in dead money.Taking that $8 million from the $22 million expected hit, that‚Äôs $14 million shaved off.Here are a couple other names to throw in this offseason, including a guy we still haven‚Äôt been able to see in a lead role.Blake Jarwin, Tight EndThe fact of the matter is, the Dallas Cowboys already had a good tight end in Dalton Schultz and they wouldn‚Äôt have figured that out if Jarwin hadn‚Äôt gotten injured. (Or maybe they would have I don‚Äôt know, roster management hasn‚Äôt always been great at the TE position for this team) When Blake Jarwin does inevitably return from injury I expect him to slide back into the offense as an H-back or even as a flanker TE as Schultz can line up predominantly as the Y-tight end for the team.However, what if you traded Jarwin away and just brought back Blake Bell instead. Trading away Jarwin saves the team over $4 million each of the next two years and likely nets the team a late day 2 or early day 3 pick. The contract is good and Jarwin‚Äôs potential is still high after a season-ending injury. The inline blocking isn‚Äôt there but what team can‚Äôt use his receiving ability? (Look at me, what a hypocrite!) He could also end up on a team that will target him more!It begs the question right? Schultz has proven to have reliable hands and has been huge for the team in the middle of the field, an area the Cowboys expected Jarwin to have an impact. While Jarwin is good, if not very good, at getting yards after the catch, Schultz is still more than good enough. Both guys are tall athletic receivers while one is a substantially better blocker than the other.The performance of Schultz has been one of the bright spots this season.Schultz has tallied 383 yards and two touchdowns on 35 catches this season, ranking him fifth in total yards among all tight ends. He‚Äôs also 6th among tight ends in receptions, is averaging 10.9 yards per catch, and 7 yards per target. Not bad at all for what is a fourth or fifth passing option in this Cowboys offense.When Dak Prescott was healthy, Schultz put up a couple monster games, getting loose in the middle of the field and off play action while the defense worried about the plethora of weapons around him.Should Dalton Schultz be the unquestioned TE1 heading into 2021? No, he should not. After all Blake Jarwin should be back and ready to go. But what the team has learned during this rough season is that Schultz is good enough to work in two tight end sets, and to give Blake Jarwin breathers when needed.Dalton Schultz is putting up a few top-10 numbers this season:

What specific area of the team needs the most help this offseason?Machota: Defensive backfield. Trevon Diggs and Anthony Brown are both returning, and that‚Äôs good news for the cornerback spot. But more help is needed. Chidobe Awuzie and Jourdan Lewis are both about to become free agents. If the Cowboys continue on their current path and land a top-five pick, cornerback will certainly be in play with their first selection. Safety continues to be an issue. Xavier Woods has started every game. He‚Äôs a free agent at the end of the season. Donovan Wilson has started five games. He‚Äôs expected to be in the mix next season. We already know it‚Äôs unlikely that they will spend significantly on the position in the draft or free agency, but some kind of noticeable upgrade needs to be made.Yousuf: It has to be the secondary. There are certainly concerns along the offensive and defensive lines, as well as one linebacker spot, but the secondary needs to be looked at very closely. Diggs is here to stay, and I think Anthony Brown has some sort of a role on this defense as well. Beyond that? No job is safe. Chidobe Awuzie‚Äôs performance as he returns from injury will be significant.Former Cowboys players from years past weigh in on what it‚Äôs like to go through such a dreadful season, and how they should be approaching things down the stretch.Washington Football Team defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio was a starting linebacker on that Cowboys team with one win that season. After giving up at least 27 points in each of the first seven games, the Dallas defense allowed more than 20 points in a game three times in the final nine contests.‚ÄúIt was tough to hear the banter, but really we had a run defensively in the second half of that season, I think we were at or near the top with what we did the last half of the year,‚Äù Del Rio said. ‚ÄúWe were building something with an eye toward the future.‚ÄúThe core of that team won three of four Super Bowls a couple years later. ... To me, even when it‚Äôs a bad record, it‚Äôs professional football; people prepare hard, they play hard; there is talent. The one victory we had that year was against the Redskins. The bottom line is we beat a good team, and we built a good team while there. Sometimes there are slow years, but the professionalism and work ethic and toughness and grit and willingness to go, none of that was missing. We weren‚Äôt very good yet, but we became good.‚ÄùBTB Podcast ScheduleWe also offer daily episodes of The Ocho where we give you that day‚Äôs latest headlines so that you always stay caught up.

We are into double-digit weeks and there is still an undefeated team. Where does everyone stack up, the Cowboys included?Welcome to our Week 11 power rankings. You can view last week‚Äôs right here.1 - Kansas City Chiefs (LW: 1)Kings stay kings.2 - Pittsburgh Steelers (LW: 2)It looks like they bounced back from their nap at AT&T Stadium.3 - Green Bay Packers (LW: 3)An almost loss, but great teams find ways to win those.4 - Arizona Cardinals (LW: 12)NFC West favorites?5 - New Orleans Saints (LW: 4)Operating without Drew Brees is going to be tough, but if anybody can do it, it‚Äôs Sean Payton.6 - Buffalo Bills (LW: 5)Tough loss to take, but this is a good team.7 - Seattle Seahawks (LW: 6)It is appropriate that Thanksgiving is next week as Russell Wilson needs to get back to cooking stat.8 - Tampa Bay Buccaneers (LW: 11)Clearly the NFC South favorites.9 - Indianapolis Colts (LW: 13)Mandatory shout out to Matt Eberflus.10 - Los Angeles Rams (LW: 14)They are so weirdly good.11 - Miami Dolphins (LW: 10)Tua hasn‚Äôt been asked to do much, but my oh my, that secondary is something.12 - Las Vegas Raiders (LW: 9)They just keep piling together weird wins.13 - Tennessee Titans (LW: 8)A tough loss on Thursday night. They might have peaked too early.14 - Baltimore Ravens (LW: 7)Where is all of the offense?15 - Cleveland Browns (LW: 15)A very WIN-dy day. I‚Äôll see myself out.16 - Minnesota Vikings (LW: 17)See you on Sunday.17 - Carolina Panthers (LW: 16)Matt Rhule is doing a far more impressive job than their record shows.18 - New England Patriots (LW: 27)Are they... back?!19 - Atlanta Falcons (LW: 18)Same ol‚Äô, same ol‚Äô.20 - Los Angeles Chargers (LW: 19)Who is going to be this team‚Äôs head coach in 2021?21 - Detroit Lions (LW: 26)Congratulations for not losing.22 - Cincinnati Bengals (LW: 20)These are all valuable lessons for young Joe Burrow.23 - San Francisco 49ers (LW: 21)Kyle Shanahan is so good, but he‚Äôs missing so much.24 - New York Giants (LW: 29)Movin‚Äô on up.25 - Denver Broncos (LW: 22)Yikes.26 - Chicago Bears (LW: 23)They were always paper tigers.27 - Houston Texans (LW: 24)There is a lot wrong there.28 - Philadelphia Eagles (LW: 25)It is starting to feel like a certain rookie quarterback might actually see the field.29 - Dallas Cowboys (LW: 28)SUPER BOWL HERE WE COME.30 - Washington Football Team (LW: 30)Kudos to Alex Smith for almost pulling it off.31 - Jacksonville Jaguars (LW: 31)Close, but no cigar.32 - New York Jets (LW: 32)Some things never change.Sometimes things stay the same.Here‚Äôs the path back to respectability for the Cowboys: Keep Andy Dalton upright and get him comfortable in this offense. Dalton struggled mightily in his initial starts following the shocking Dak Prescott injury, then disappeared down a grim concussion and COVID-19 wormhole. When he returns to the field, he‚Äôll be the quarterback of an offense that includes Amari CooperÔªø, Ezekiel ElliottÔªø, Michael Gallup and CeeDee LambÔªø. You‚Äôd think Mike McCarthy and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore have been in dialogue with Dalton about plays and concepts that were successful for him during his Bengals salad days. Given the firepower of this offense, Dalton should be able to lead this team to competence on offense, at the very least. If he can‚Äôt, that‚Äôs on the coaching staff as much as the quarterback.No movement from the worldwide leader.What would they take back: Not re-signing Byron JonesJust one? So many to pick from and some might trace back to not signing Dak Prescott long term, which helped lead to the big deal Jaylon Smith signed that ultimately cost them Jones. Yes, you want cornerbacks to take the ball away more than Jones, but what about the full body of work? Add this to the list: If the Cowboys knew they could get CeeDee Lamb in the first round, would they still have signed Amari Cooper to a long-term deal? Not at $20 million a year, which could have left room for Jones too. 2020 has been a huge mess, but the Cowboys should have made a bigger pitch to keep Jones. ‚Äî Todd ArcherA backwards bump.After coping with a concussion and COVID-19 isolation, QB Andy Dalton is back for a team that could use good news as it prepares to play its next three games in 12 days.Same here.The Cowboys had a bye and made up ground on both the Eagles and Washington while losing a little on the Giants, whom they already beat. Who knows, maybe some rest and extra film work will help Andy Dalton lead the offense better and the defense can build on that Steelers game to save some face in the second half.At least they didn‚Äôt fall here, too?Andy Dalton was back at practice on Monday and will presumably return from a concussion. Make all the knee-jerk reactions you want, but Dalton still gives the Cowboys the best chance to win. And, crazy enough, they have just one fewer win than the top two teams in the division.And we‚Äôre back to falling.They come off the bye still in the division race. But can they get it going? They play a tough road game against a resurgent Vikings team this week.The closest to number one!The Cowboys likely get Andy Dalton back this week. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll matter much, and that‚Äôs less about Dalton than it is about a patched together o-line."

After seeing several players go on the COVID reserve list the last few weeks, the coaching staff is creating their own bubble for the rest of the season to prevent further spread.To that end, the team has established a bubble during their Week 10 bye ‚Äî sources confirm to CBS Sports ‚Äî specifically for all staff that has direct contact with players. This is similar to what the team did in training camp, and at the same location, when a large number of players took up residence at the Omni Hotel attached to Cowboys headquarters at The Star in Frisco, TX. The team entered intensive protocols after the Pittsburgh Steelers ran into positive COVID-19 results following the battle in Week 9 at AT&T Stadium, but the bubble is Jones‚Äô way of ensuring the Cowboys aren‚Äôt the next team to throw the league into disarray.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going in a more intense way, and we‚Äôre having our coaches restrict their activities away from the field and restrict their contacts away from the field,‚Äù Jones said to 105.3FM the Fan on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having all staff that touch a player do that. That‚Äôs in addition to what the NFL is doing.‚ÄùThe Omni Hotel is directly connected to The Ford Center (a 12,000-seat practice venue), and isn‚Äôt lacking for whatever the staff might need. For Jones and the Cowboys, it‚Äôs all about not getting comfortable ‚Äî something they were reminded against by a recent move of both quarterback Andy Dalton and Tyrone Crawford to the COVID-19 list. While it‚Äôs unclear if Dalton had contracted the illness, separate sources confirm Crawford did not, but instead had contact with someone who had. Both moves marked the first time since Ezekiel Elliott tested positive in July that the Cowboys had a run-in with the novel coronavirus.The Cowboys defense is starting to get things together, but that won‚Äôt stop them from adding talent. On Tuesday they added the former 46th overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, Breeland Speaks, to their practice squad.Speaks was a 2018 second-round draft decision of the Chiefs. He totaled 24 tackles and 1.5 sacks and appeared in all 16 games as a rookie. He spent part of his second-season campaign on injured reserve. The Ole Miss product also, while he was on IR, handed an NFL suspension of four games for violating the league‚Äôs substance-abuse policy.‚ÄúHe came into camp and had lost weight and was healthy and I think he was able to practice throughout the course of the preseason and he worked hard to put himself in that position, so when guys are ready to go, we defer to the medical expertise of our staff and we let them go out there and compete and see how everything shakes out,‚Äù Veach continued. ‚ÄúAgain, it certainly did put him behind the eight-ball in that regard. Not having a year of football is certainly going to be tough.‚Äô‚ÄôOur man @BryanBroaddus on @1053thefan on #Cowboys Speaks: ‚ÄòAthletic, heavy-handed guy who can play multiple spots on DL ...‚Äô https://t.co/R17FMIlvk0Jaylon Smith has had quite the rough stretch this year, frequently looking out of position on plays and giving up easy completions or runs. While there are rumors he could be falling out of favor with the new staff, his contract situation also sets the stage for a swift exit in the offseason.The reality is Smith doesn‚Äôt have anymore guaranteed money left in his deal unless he‚Äôs on the roster on the fifth day of the 2021 league season. If he is, Smith‚Äôs 2021 salary ($7.2 million) becomes fully guaranteed. The same goes for 2022.If Dallas releases Smith before June 1, he‚Äôd count $9.4 million against the cap in dead money. He‚Äôs on the books to take up $9.8 million (salary plus $2.6 million on bonuses), so they‚Äôd save $400,000 by cutting him.As for replacing Smith, he‚Äôs really had one outstanding season and that was 2018. You could find a comparable replacement in free agency or in Rounds 2 or 3 of the draft. In 2018, his first season as a full-time starter, Smith had 121 tackles, four sacks, two forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. He also had six tackles for loss and six quarterback hits. No doubt, he‚Äôs a talented guy. Consistency has been his issue. Smith makes a lot of tackles ‚Äî 89 so far this season ‚Äî but not many of them have been impact plays. He‚Äôs been nonexistent as a pass rusher this year with just half a sack.The 2020 season has been rough for the Cowboys - that‚Äôs what happens when you lose your franchise quarterback - but it hasn‚Äôt been without some positives. CeeDee Lamb already looks like a bona fide superstar, and Zack Martin is showing that he‚Äôs still the cream of the crop among interior offensive linemen.Zack Martin might seem like the last man standing on the offensive line. Travis Frederick retired. La‚Äôel Collins did not play a snap this season because of hip surgery. Left tackle Tyron Smith played two games before a neck injury shut down his season.Martin, the Cowboys‚Äô 2014 first-round pick, missed one game because of a concussion, but he has been his normal, dominant self, especially in the Philadelphia game against Fletcher Cox. He also was able to swing out to right tackle in the Week 3 game at Seattle. The Cowboys believe Smith and Collins will be back to normal in 2021; Biadasz has the look of a starter, and Martin is still Martin. Although Smith‚Äôs recurring injury problem is a concern and might warrant a look at his successor in April‚Äôs NFL draft, the line might not be as far off as some think.‚ÄúYou see the impact of having Zack Martin as opposed to not having him,‚Äù McCarthy said. ‚ÄúHe brings that to your offensive line. He keeps that group tight. He‚Äôs definitely an excellent leader. I‚Äôve been very impressed with that. His level of play is extremely consistent, and he makes players better around him. ... You don‚Äôt get into the National Football League being an average player. To me, they‚Äôre all good players, and the great ones make people around them better, and Zack Martin is definitely that guy for us.‚ÄùAfter the Giants defeated the Eagles this week, the NFC East is once again wide open. Despite the Cowboys currently being on pace for the third overall draft selection, a win or two would vault them to first place. So who has the edge in this ugly division race?Nick: Everyone has an edge it seems. Momentum and division wins? It‚Äôs the Giants. How about the best defense? It‚Äôs Washington. Better quarterback and actual division lead at the moment? Eagles. And what about the most favorable schedule down the stretch? That‚Äôs the Cowboys. So all of these teams have a shot to win it because they‚Äôre all right there. As for Dallas, this team has to show at some point they can go get a win. It‚Äôs been well over a month without a victory so if they have any thoughts of getting into the mix, obviously they need to start winning.David: I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm typing this, but it‚Äôs hard not to like the Cowboys‚Äô chances when you consider what‚Äôs ahead. Dallas is the only team in the NFC East with three division games left, which means they get to play almost half their remaining games against putrid competition. Throw in games against middling teams like Minnesota, Cincinnati and San Francisco, and all of a sudden it looks like there‚Äôs a path to five or six wins. It‚Äôs going to hinge on getting solid quarterback play from Andy Dalton. But in this division, 6-10 might sadly be just good enough.The Cowboys may still technically be in the playoff hunt, but the season is over whether or not they end up hosting a postseason game. With that in mind, the Cowboys would do well to start playing some of their younger talent, such as Bradlee Anae, to see what they can do.We shouldn‚Äôt expect Bradlee Anae to step on the field and be an immediate difference-maker, but in a lost season, he should be given opportunities to gain experience. The player above him on the depth chart, Dorance Armstrong, hasn‚Äôt exactly lit the world on fire with his play this season.Armstrong has been utterly unimpactful, only generating five pressures and four stops in the 182 snaps he‚Äôs played this season, per Pro Football Focus. That‚Äôs not the type of production that should warrant playing Armstrong overwhelmingly more than Anae.In fact, there‚Äôs reason to believe that Anae could have a bigger impact as a pass rusher than Armstrong has thus far. Coming of Utah, Anae possessed one of the most well-developed pass-rush skill sets in the entire 2020 draft class. He posted three straight seasons with at least seven sacks and 10 tackles for loss. He tallied three sacks in his Senior Bowl appearance.Ezekiel Elliott can be a polarizing figure, especially this season with his inconsistent performances. It was just a year ago that he was locked up to a really rich deal, but could the end already be in sight?Here is where it gets rather problematic. If they chose a player who was and is and will be elite, we have no problems. Athletes make tons of money, franchises make tons of money and, provided, it all is sorted fairly, we often just want to see the best players get rewarded for as long as they are the best players.Elliott still has the biggest contract and one of the biggest reputations. He is just 25 years old, and even with a new coaching staff, he is still being given the ball a lot and the marketing materials still suggest that you are tuning in to see Elliott do his thing. But as I write this today, it is very difficult to find a way to suggest Elliott is the best running back in football. It is very difficult to suggest he is a top-five running back in football. And the more you dig, the more you wonder where he ranks.But, first, let‚Äôs look at the entirety of Elliott‚Äôs five-year run in terms of the most basic metric, scrimmage yards per game. However a player gets the ball, rushing or receiving, this is his total contribution per game.BTB Podcast ScheduleWe also offer daily episodes of The Ocho where we give you that day‚Äôs latest headlines so that you always stay caught up.

615,cowboys,https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2020/11/13/21562787/start-or-sit-nfl-fantasy-football-tips-for-week-10,Start or Sit? NFL fantasy football tips for Week 10,"FILED UNDER:What players make the cut in this week‚Äôs start/sit list?It‚Äôs already Week 10 of the 2020 NFL season, which means there are only a few weeks remaining in the fantasy football regular season. As games become more and more meaningful, it‚Äôs important to fill out that starting lineup to maximum efficiency. Each week we‚Äôre faced with some tough choices as deciding which fringe players to insert into your lineup isn‚Äôt always cut and dry. So, we‚Äôre here to help you out with this week‚Äôs fantasy start/sit suggestions.Jared Goff (Rams) vs. Seattle Seahawks (Week 10 position rank: 10th)It‚Äôs just become a regular thing for the opposing quarterback of the Seahawks to have big games as their defense gives up a ridiculous amount of fantasy points to the position. After failing to get inside the top 15 QB finishes the previous four weeks, the Bills‚Äô Josh Allen returned to relevance with a top 2 finish last week. That‚Äôs what facing the Seahawks will do for you. Jared Goff is just a middling fantasy quarterback that mostly finishes somewhere between 10 and 20, so he doesn‚Äôt bring a lot of excitement to your fantasy lineup, but that could change this week.Joe Burrows (Bengals) vs. Pittsburgh Steelers (Week 10 position rank: 17th)Fantasy owners have been pleased with the rookie because he throws the ball a ton. Between yardage and touchdowns, Burrows has been able to put together a solid fantasy season. He‚Äôs just a couple weeks removed from a 404-yard, four-touchdown performance where he finished as the fourth-best scoring fantasy QB for the week. That‚Äôs what he can do with a great matchup. Unfortunately, this week is not so great as he faces a Steelers defense that is the best in the league at getting after the quarterback. When Burrows faced the Ravens earlier in the year, Burrows was shut down as it was the only game this season he hasn‚Äôt thrown a touchdown in and he only had 183 yards passing. With a shaky offensive line, this one could be a little bumpy for this year‚Äôs no. 1 overall pick.Leonard Fournette (Bucs) vs. Carolina Panthers (Week 10 position rank: 15th)It has to be frustrating if you own any of the Bucs running backs as you never know what you‚Äôre going to get during any given game. But what we can tell you is that the Panthers surrender the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. With both Ronald Jones and Fournette likely seeing a fair dose of touches, the opportunity is there for either of them to have a big game. And don‚Äôt be discouraged by last week‚Äôs shutdown as the Saints front seven is much more dominant than the Panthers. The last time these two teams squared off, Fournette ran for 102 yards on just 12 carries and scored twice, making him the fourth-highest scoring RB for the week. Even without an abundance of work, don‚Äôt be shocked if he puts up a similar performance.Jerick McKinnon (49ers) vs. New Orleans Saints (Week 10 position rank: 19th)Most weeks you‚Äôre happy to start the 49ers running back who is getting the lion‚Äôs share of the touches in the backfield. Last week it was McKinnon who held that job, and he performed okay thanks to finding the end zone. But that game was against the Packers, who allow the second-most fantasy points to running backs. Now, McKinnon will go up against one of the toughest defenses against fantasy running backs in the Saints. That, combined with a timeshare role, makes this a very unattractive start for him this week.Josh Reynolds (Rams) vs. Seattle Seahawks (Week 10 position rank: 58th)If you are scrambling for a player to plug into your flex, then you‚Äôve come to the right place as we dig deep for this one. Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods owners are salivating at the mouth as they get to attack that fantasy-friendly Seahawks defense, but what if we told you that there is plenty of love to go around. Gabriel Davis of the Bills (who is that?) put together a 15-point performance last week, making it the fifth time this season that three wide receivers from the same team have produced double-digit fantasy performances against the Seahawks this season. When you consider that Reynolds already has a role regular in the Rams offense and that he‚Äôs coming off two straight games with at least eight targets, the opportunity is there for this deep sleeper pick to have a nice game this week.Mike Evans (Bucs) vs. Carolina Panthers (Week 10 position rank: 24th)This suggestion is a little weird because Evans owners aren‚Äôt going to be sitting a talented receiver in a contest with the potential for a game script with a lot of points. We understand that. However, it should be noted that there are a few things going on here that could lead to an underwhelming performance by a Bucs receivers. For starters, there are a lot of mouths to feed with not only Evans, Chris Godwin, and Rob Gronkowski, but now Antonio Brown is in the mix. If last week was any indication, Brown‚Äôs going to be cutting into those targets. And when you consider that teams have a lot of success on the ground against the Panthers, the well is going to run dry for someone in that receiving group.Eric Ebron (Steelers) vs. Cincinnati Bengals (Week 10 position rank: 9th)The veteran wide receiver continues to get looks as he‚Äôs gotten at least five targets in six of the Steelers last seven games. Ebron has finished inside the top 10 for fantasy tight ends in two consecutive weeks. Of course, a big reason for that is that he‚Äôs caught a touchdown in both of those games. Like most tight ends in the league, Ebron is touchdown dependent, but that‚Äôs okay as he‚Äôll face a Bengals defense that has surrendered five touchdowns to tight ends over their last three games. Cincy gives up the most fantasy points to opposing tight ends, making Ebron a solid play this week.Jared Cook (Saints) vs. San Francisco 49ers (Week 10 position rank: 11th)Cook has been a solid fantasy performer thanks to a Saints offense that is fourth in the league in points scored. Over his last four games, three times he‚Äôs finished in the top six for fantasy tight ends. But in each of those games he was fortunate enough to find the end zone. This week, he‚Äôll face a stingy 49ers defense who doesn‚Äôt give up many fantasy points to opposing tight ends. And when you factor in that Michael Thomas is back and should demand a good share of targets, Cook could be in for a quiet afternoon.New York Giants vs. Philadelphia Eagles (Week 10 position rank: 10th)Last week we suggested starting the Giants defense against Washington and they finished as the fourth-best fantasy defense for the week. That dreadful NFC East is the gift that keeps on giving.If you play fantasy football, here's a good tip...

Start any DEFENSE playing against an NFC East team. All four of them are ranked in the top six in surrendering the most points to opposing defenses. pic.twitter.com/UCkYHi2hSpSo, it shouldn‚Äôt be that much of a surprise to see that we‚Äôre going to double-down with the Giants again as they go up against the Eagles. In fact, the Eagles are slightly more generous than Washington, so the stage is set for another quality outing by the Giants.Miami Dolphins vs. Los Angeles Chargers (Week 10 position rank: 12th)The Dolphins have a good defense, and they have finished in the top seven for the week in four straight games. This week, they‚Äôll face a Chargers team that has been fairly good on offense in recent games. Despite their inability to close the deal at the end of games, the offense can put up points. Thanks to a productive rookie quarterback in Justin Herbert, the Chargers have scored at least 26 points in five straight games. The Dolphins defense will make plays, but this one could be a lot more high-scoring than some expect."
616,cowboys,https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2020/11/17/21570434/cowboys-rookie-report-the-emergence-of-neville-gallimore#comments,Cowboys rookie report: The emergence of Neville Gallimore,"FILED UNDER:Gallimore is a rookie to watch in the Cowboys‚Äô next few slates.Dallas‚Äô unloading of a few big-name signings was one of the best things that could‚Äôve happened to them all season. The team - which has consistently opted to stay away from blockbuster free agent deals through the past few off-seasons (Earl Thomas is the most prominent of several names that fit this description) - finally bit the bullet this past summer and opened their checkbooks to incumbent playmakers.They inked deals with a bevy of the market‚Äôs more high-caliber weapons, including Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Aldon Smith, Dontari Poe and Everson Griffen.The result was a rarity for the Jones family - a full-on wheel-and-deal rendezvous in hopes to strengthen their front line with enough stability to make a deep push into the playoffs.We know now that‚Äôs about as wishful a thought as lottery-winning daydreams. And when their fort began to cave in as the season wore on, the Cowboys‚Äô front office had no choice but to surrender a few of their men to battle.They parted ways with both Poe and Griffen, who at that point had done very little to live up to the hype that had paraded them into town. Their jobs on Dallas‚Äô defensive line were simple: Poe was to use every ounce of his gaudy 6‚Äô3, 346-lb frame to cause enormous commotion inside, while Griffen, who had knowingly digressed due to age, was going to be counted on to resurface some rendition of the sack prowess that had wafted him to four Pro Bowl appearances.Neither did anything of the sort.Poe was labeled out of shape by several defensive coaches, and found himself thrust out of countless A-gap holes that led to gargantuan opposing rushing outputs. Griffen, on the other hand, was a step too slow in far too many plays that required his vanquishing abilities, and at times looked as if he were running with cement blocks bound to his ankles as quicker running backs scurried out of his clutches.And both were none too surprised when janitor Jones came sweeping in to clean up their mess, shipping both out of the Star with rapidity.The newly-freed roster spots not only gave Dallas‚Äô front office breathing room in their pockets, but provided lesser-known greenhorns with ample playing time to make a lasting impression.One such rookie is Neville Gallimore.Gallimore, who measures out much thinner than Poe‚Äôs massive girth at 302 lbs, makes up for it with a sneaky-sly nimbleness, and quick-twitch dexterity that rivals athletes much smaller than him in size.But don't let that fool you. He‚Äôs still a mammoth of a man, and his ability to go both through, and around opposing blockers will serve the Cowboys well as this marathon season wears on.Little has been unearthed of the 23-year-old Oklahoma product in terms of stat sheet production. In fact, he just recently earned his playing wings in the ‚ÄòBoys Week 5 matchup vs. the Giants. Gallimore finished with just one tackle in 22 snaps, but saw that number balloon to four with one stop in the backfield (38 snaps) vs. Washington, and three, plus another tackle for loss in their Pittsburgh standoff.His opportunities only project to go up from here.And with little else to look forward to, perhaps Gallimore can be one of this year‚Äôs feel-good stories that lightens a murky outlook."
617,cowboys,https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2020/11/17/21570396/fantasy-football-waiver-wire-pickups-for-week-11,Fantasy football waiver wire pickups for Week 11,"FILED UNDER:Here are your weekly waiver wire suggestions...With the trade deadline past (or soon-to-be passing in some leagues), all we have left to depend on is the pool of players remaining on the waiver wire. With just a few weeks left before the fantasy playoffs kickoff, it‚Äôs important to keep our rosters as strong as possible. To help you out, here are some low-rostered players who could make nice adds to your team in this week‚Äôs waiver wire suggestions.Normally, quarterbacks mentioned atop the waiver wire pick list are coming off great performances, but that is not the case here. Winston completed 6/10 passes for just 63 yards and nothing about his play warrants optimism. The former no. 1 overall pick was off target at times, and he demonstrated why he is now just a backup. While all of that doesn‚Äôt fill you with optimism, this next part will. The Saints go against he Atlanta Falcons this week, who give up the most fantasy points against opposing quarterbacks. If Brees isn‚Äôt able to go, Winston could make an appealing plug and play.The Giants quarterback hasn‚Äôt been anyone you‚Äôd want to start as his QB finishes have been middling at best. However, he is coming off his first top 10 finish on Sunday against the Eagles, and has now finished inside the top 15 in three of the last four weeks. His floor is pretty respectable due to his built in rushing yards, and he‚Äôs now put together two consecutive games without an interception. He‚Äôs on a bye this week, but he‚Äôs staring at a few really nice matchups in upcoming weeks, including a very fantasy-friendly Seahawks defense.Hines owners have had an off-and-on relationship that could rival Ross and Rachel. One week, he‚Äôll tear it up. The next week, he‚Äôll be invisible. After a dismal two-carry, 18-yard performance in Week 9, there‚Äôs a good chance fantasy owners were on a break. That meant his 26 fantasy points (finishing as the fourth-best RB for the week) went by the wayside. If you dare give him another chance, he does face a Packers team this week that allows the second-most fantasy points to opposing running backs.If you scooped up Ahmed at the last second and started him against the Chargers, congrats. You landed yourself a nice 15.5 outing from him. Due to injuries, the Dolphins have relied on a slew of different backs to help out, and right now that falls on Ahmed. His 21 carries on Sunday is volume that‚Äôs hard to find. And when you factor in that this Dolphins team is now a top 10 offense in points, the scoring opportunities just add to his appeal.The rookie receiver offered a lot of promise this year, but a trip to injured reserve set him back. But Pittman gradually has been working his way into this offense since coming off IR, and he is coming of his best game with a seven-catch, 101-yard performance Thursday night. If the newfound love from Philip Rivers in terms of target share can be sustained, Pittman can be a viable receiving option down the stretch.The veteran receiver is coming off a two-touchdown performance on Sunday night, and that was good enough to finish as the no. 3 scoring WR for the week. This is likely just a flash-in-the-pan performance, but the fact that he‚Äôs had a double-digit finish in two of the past three weeks shouldn‚Äôt go unnoticed. Couple that with the fact that Marquise Brown hasn‚Äôt reached eight points in any of his past four games makes things a little murky with the Ravens passing game. If Snead continues to see this target share, especially those that end with a celebration, he could push his way into fantasy relevance.Over the last four games, Thomas has served as a decent tight end play as he has three top 10 finishes in that span. His ability to always get at least four targets in every game has provided owners with a good floor as he‚Äôll always get his owners something. Thomas doesn‚Äôt offer up any upside, but his looks combined with a matchup against the Bengals who surrender the most fantasy points to opposing tight ends points to him being someone worthy plugging into your lineup this weekend.If you took a flyer on Reed after hearing the news of George Kittle, you weren‚Äôt very pleased to see his one-catch, three-yard performance against the Packers in Week 9. He was a stash and wait type of player, and the early results weren‚Äôt promising. But on Sunday, he bounced back nicely with a five-catch, 62-yard game. Reed‚Äôs on a bye this week, but if he slowly starts earning some target shares, he has potential to offer fantasy owners something in upcoming weeks.The Chargers defense hasn‚Äôt been that great this year as they‚Äôve allowed at least 29 points in six straight games. They do generate pressure; however, it hasn‚Äôt always translated to sacks. This week, they‚Äôll draw the New York Jets who allow the most fantasy points to opposing defenses. The opportunity is there for the Chargers to be a solid fantasy producer on Sunday."

And I think they‚Äôre going to just look at financially and look at his production and go, ‚ÄòGuys, it might be best to take a hit now and open up money for later.‚ÄôIt‚Äôs not the season fans wanted, but the rookie class is promising.‚ÄúThose top three picks, all of them are really playing well or coming,‚Äù executive vice president Stephen Jones said. ‚ÄúObviously Neville (Gallimore) had his best game (against the Steelers before the bye). I think he‚Äôs really starting to get a feel for what we‚Äôre wanting out of him. And then Diggs has had a, we‚Äôve, from the day he walked in the door, we thought he could really be a big playmaker for us and certainly the same goes for CeeDee Lamb.‚ÄùAnd don‚Äôt forget the fourth-rounder.Tyler Biadasz, fourth round, CHe was drafted to replace Travis Frederick in 2021, but his chance came sooner with the injury to Joe Looney. Biadasz can get stronger, something that will happen with a normal-type offseason, but he‚Äôs progressing. He‚Äôs out for a couple of weeks with a hamstring injury.An in-depth dive into the ‚ÄòBoys misfortunes.A team picked by many to compete for the playoffs and perhaps even further than that, the Cowboys have been completely decimated by injuries and limped to the open week with a 2-7 record.But injuries haven‚Äôt been the only problem. Even when Dak Prescott went down, the team had struggled to a 2-3 record, but have since lost four straight without him.Let‚Äôs take a closer look at this team that still has seven games to go.The Cowboys got some needed help in their own division from the G-Men.The Dallas Cowboys went into their Week 10 bye week with two possibilities still on the table. Option one was to hope the better play of the defense and a fresh quarterback in Andy Dalton could turn the season around the final seven games on Big D‚Äôs schedule.Option two was to hope some of the bottom feeders around the NFL will start winning games and the Cowboys position in the 2021 NFL Draft is improved.The New York Giants satisfied both options this Sunday with a 27-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Moving America‚Äôs Team to only a game and a half away from the top position in the division.This could be a much longer list...Dontari Poe, DTThe Dallas Cowboys run defense has been perhaps the most disappointing and underachieving part of the entire team this season. Which is really saying something.2020 was finally the year the Cowboys addressed the run-stopping portion of their game. After neglecting the 1-tech spot for years, they finally bit the bullet and signed a proven free agent vet. Dontari Poe was that vet.Poe failed in virtually every facet of the game. He was worthless against the pass, uninterested in gap responsibilities, and about as stout as a giraffe on roller skates as the 1-tech. Poe was pushed around and manipulated on the regular. Even with the rotation piece of Antwaun Woods behind him keeping him fresh, Poe looked washed on every play. There‚Äôs a reason he was a midseason cut.A vote for Dalton‚Äôs return as head honcho.Remember how we felt after Andy came in after Dak‚Äôs injury and engineered a late-game drive to get the win. There was a lot of optimism about what Dallas could still do given the weak NFC East and what we saw from Dalton in that victory.In hindsight, maybe that had more to do with how bad the Giants are. But again, have we seen enough of Dalton in reasonable circumstances to make a confident evaluation?Losing Zack Martin for Andy‚Äôs two starts was a death blow to the Cowboys‚Äô ability to function offensively. Since his return, we‚Äôve seen how Martin‚Äôs presence stabilizes things across the board for the offense. Even without his Pro Bowl teammates around him, Zack can at least help keep things solvent.Dalton deserves a chance to play with Zack Martin in front of him. He deserves an opportunity to compete with the Cowboys defense finally showing up to play.King may not be the only one with this opinion, but he is one of the first to say it.Regarding their future at quarterback, the Dallas Cowboys are currently in a no-win situation.At least, that‚Äôs what NFL analyst and sportswriter Peter King thinks.While Jerry Jones, Stephen Jones and the rest of the Cowboys‚Äô front office has remained consistent in saying that Dak Prescott will be their guy moving forward, King pointed out that it‚Äôs not so simple on a recent episode of NBC‚Äôs Pro Football Talk.King believes that salary cap uncertainty, Prescott‚Äôs injury and other factors could weigh heavily on Dallas‚Äô draft decisions. While the Cowboys may not be in position to draft an elite QB, the franchise must still prepare for that possibility, according to King.A couple of Cowboys vets get some love as they are voted to a mid-season All-Pro team.RG ZACK MARTIN, DALLAS COWBOYSSecond Team: Shaq Mason, New England PatriotsThe last member still standing of the once-best offensive line in football, Zack Martin is still doing an outstanding job despite everything around him collapsing in on itself.His run-blocking grade this season is bested only by Cleveland‚Äôs Wyatt Teller, and though his pass protection has been a little weaker than in years past, it can largely be explained by the influence of constant quarterback change and weaker players on either side of him than he is used to.DeMarcus Lawrence was selected to the second-team at edge.BTB Podcast ScheduleWe also offer daily episodes of The Ocho where we give you that day‚Äôs latest headlines so that you always stay caught up.

Would we even want that?The NFC East is a disaster in 2020. Actually that is sort of offensive to disasters. It‚Äôs hard to define just what the NFL‚Äôs most storied division is this year, but it isn‚Äôt anything worth writing home about (please pay attention as I am writing about it). Consider that the division collectively has less wins (10) than the number of the week that we are on (11) if you somehow don‚Äôt believe this thing to be a dumpster fire.The Dallas Cowboys, like their rivals, have lost a lot of players this season. This truth has certainly contributed to how difficult the season has been and to the ever-perpetuating idea of tanking for a higher draft pick in 2021.As silly as it will end up being, the reality of the way that the rules work in the NFL is that one of these four teams is not only going to make the postseason but even host a playoff game. We have watched them all be their own unique messes just about every week of the season, but none of them have more than three wins or less than two. They are all squarely in it, the Cowboys included.Time has stood still in this particular calendar year, but amazingly by next Friday the Thanksgiving holiday will be in the rearview mirror.Of course, this means that between now and then the Dallas Cowboys (2-7) will play two professional football games, assuming you want to call what they have been doing ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù. The group showed something in their last outing against the Pittsburgh Steelers two weeks ago and so it is obviously possible that we see that translate past the bye week when the coaching staff had even more time to plan, prepare, and all of that jazz. Plus, the Cowboys have two low-quality opponents coming up in the Minnesota Vikings (4-5) and Washington Football Team (2-7).Consider that of the seven remaining games for the Cowboys, six of them are against teams with a record below .500. This is looking a bit down the road and past the two week point that we are currently talking about, but perhaps it helps you understand how some are reluctant to toss in the towel on the 2020 season. The point is that, to quote the great philosopher Kevin Garnett, anything is possible here.We previously noted that the NFC East has fewer wins than the number of the week that we are on, but do you know how many of those have come outside of the division? Of the 10 victories that NFC East teams have tasted so far this season, only two have come outside of these four teams. One of them belongs to the Cowboys as they beat the Atlanta Falcons off of a miracle ending (the Philadelphia Eagles beat the San Francisco 49ers earlier in the season).This isn‚Äôt about false optimism, but that number is rather unlikely to grow as the season rides through November and December. Consider the non-NFC East games that all four teams have to play and it‚Äôs hard to talk yourself into any of them winning a single one.So now let‚Äôs talk about just these next two weeks for a second. The New York Giants are on bye and we won‚Äôt see them again until after turkey has been consumed, but they will have to take on a Cincinnati Bengals team that has looked solid in Joe Burrow‚Äôs first year. That‚Äôs who Washington will face this week. It is possible that Cincy beats them both. Likely even.The Philadelphia Eagles have to visit the Cleveland Browns this week and look incapable of putting anything together offensively. Myles Garrett will likely complicate those matters all the more and after that game is all said and done things will hardly get easier for Philly when the host the Seattle Seahawks on the Monday night after Thanksgiving.It is for this reason that it is legitimately possible that on the morning of December 1st that the Dallas Cowboys could be the lone NFC East team with at least four wins. All that stands in their way is a Minnesota Vikings team that barley did enough to beat the Chicago Bears and a Washington Football Team that broke them beyond oblivion a month ago. No big deal, of course.We have spent the last week talking about how we saw legitimate progress from Mike McCarthy‚Äôs group against the Pittsburgh Steelers. If that group returns with some more momentum on top of it thanks to the bye, then it is possible that they beat two lowly teams over the course of the next week or so, and that we are in the middle of ultimate chaos for the final month of the season.Wouldn‚Äôt that be the true and total 2020 way?"

The Cowboys are tied with three other teams at 2-7, and hold the 3rd overall spot only by virtue of their Strength of Schedule. If the season were to end today, teams with identical records would ‚Äúcycle‚Äù picks in each round. For the Cowboys, that means they have the 3rd spot in the first round, then drop to the 6th spot in the second round, move back up to the 5th spot in the third round, the 4th spot in the fourth round, and so on as the draft order for the Cowboys, Washington, the Chargers, and Miami (via Houston) cycles in each round.Additionally, the Cowboys currently stand to receive four compensatory draft picks in the 2021 draft, per the 2021 Compensatory Pick Projection from OverTheCap.com.Add that all up and the Cowboys currently hold the following picks with the corresponding draft value (per the Trade Value Chart):Those picks are not written in stone. We‚Äôre in the middle of the season, the Cowboys could still move up and down the draft order, the comp picks may not turn out exactly as anticipated, and that pick from Detroit might move down a round (or entirely disappear) depending on Everson Griffen‚Äôs playing time in Detroit.But even if we understand that this is just a snapshot, as far as draft value goes, the Cowboys could end up with the most draft capital since 1992, as the table below illustrates.So what does that mean for the 2021 draft?Let‚Äôs take a step back and first look at how to define ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù for a draft class. Some people might use the number of Pro Bowlers drafted, others might argue that number of starters is a better measure, others yet might use playing time as an argument.All of that is combined in a metric called ‚ÄùCareer Approximate Value‚Äù (CarAV) from Pro-Football-Reference.com. If we use CarAV as a measure of draft success and plot it against the Cowboys draft capital of the last two decades we get the following graphs, starting with the data from 2000-2009I divided the data into two parts, 2000-2009 and 2010-2019. For one thing, that gives me an even split between the two periods. But it also accounts for the fact that the CarAV for younger draft classes will continue to increase in the coming years, while the players drafted between 2000 and 2009 have all ended their careers - and we‚Äôll look at the younger draft classes a little farther down this post anyway.What this chart shows is that the success of the Cowboys drafts between 2000 and 2009 has largely been a function of the draft capital available. This of course runs counter to all the modern-day draft mythology about scouting prowess, insights generated from months of film study, or secret meetings with prospects.In statistics, the relationship between two variables is called a correlation, and the strength of that correlation is measured by the ‚Äúcorrelation coefficient‚Äù. This coefficient (r¬≤) is expressed as a number between 1 and -1. The closer the r¬≤ number is to 1 or -1, the stronger the relationship between the two variables. The closer it is to zero, the weaker the relationship.For the Cowboys, the correlation here is a whopping 0.79, which tells us that historically the Cowboys have drafted better the more draft capital they‚Äôve had.This is not rocket science: You‚Äôre likely going to have more draft success picking at the top of each round than you will drafting at the bottom of each round.In the next chart, I plotted the same data for 2010-2019:The correlation here is not quite as strong as in the earlier graph, but keep in mind that the CarAV values for some of the more recent draft classes are bound to increase quite substantially over the coming years. However, some of the older draft classes are pretty much maxed out. 2013 is already locked (none of the players drafted are still active), and Sean Lee (2010), Tyron Smith (2011), and Tyrone Crawford (2012) probably won‚Äôt add much more to the totals of their draft classes.But back to the question at hand: What does the Cowboys‚Äô draft capital mean for the 2021 draft?With 3,237 draft value points, 2021 could end up right there with some of the franchise-defining drafts since 1992.How the 2021 draft class ultimately turns out is anybody‚Äôs guess, especially with half the season still to be played. Everybody will draw their own conclusions from the data above, but my expectation is that all four picks in the top 100 should deliver future starters, and they may get lucky with one of their picks in the later rounds. And if the team finds a way to increase their picks in the top 100 by either trading down or trading up (or both) that would just increase their chances of landing future contributors.The data presented here suggests the draft is less a matter of skill and more a matter of the draft capital you‚Äôve amassed, with some good or bad luck thrown into the mix. As such, with a potential franchise-defining draft on the horizon, is there any reason to squander that chance for some meaningless wins in the second half of an already lost season?"

Amazingly as we enter Week 11 the division collectively has fewer combined wins (10) than the number of weeks of the NFL season.Of course, division rivals losing (save for the New York Giants who only won because they were playing another team within the division in the Philadelphia Eagles) continues to breathe life into the idea that Dallas can be the team to put on some caps and t-shirts closer to Christmas time.If the Cowboys were to somehow find a way to magically put it together in order to accomplish this, they are going to have to start winning some football games. Dallas visits the Minnesota Vikings in Week 10 and one oddsmaker thinks it is going to be rather difficult for them to come out on top.When you look at the post-bye schedule for the Cowboys, there are few teams that truly strike fear in opponents. Of course, this assumes that you are talking about a team that is capable of taking advantage of weaker groups, and the Cowboys have not shown an ability to do that so far in 2020.The Minnesota Vikings were off to a lowly start but do look a tiny bit better as of late (winning at Lambeau Field will have that sort of effect). Vikings running back Dalvin Cook is one of the best in the NFL at his position and the prospect of stopping him is a daunting one; oddsmakers seemingly agree. Our friends at BetOnline have the Cowboys opening as 8.5-point underdogs to the Vikings.Prior to their game against the Steelers, the Cowboys had amazingly managed to not beat the spread in a single one of their games. That drought ended the day that the world got to know Garrett Gilbert with a star on his helmet, but admittedly 8.5 points is a lot.There are obviously those who will do different things with this information and for what it‚Äôs worth I like the Cowboys on this line as they have had the extra week to put together a proper game plan. What‚Äôs more is that the Vikings will be coming off of a short week as they are playing on Monday Night Football to wrap up Week 10.For what it‚Äôs worth, Mike McCarthy‚Äôs Green Bay Packers teams were 9-4 in games immediately following the bye week. He mentioned during the lead-up to the Steelers game that the team would practice his ‚Äúacross the hall‚Äù strategy during the off week where the offensive coaches would work with the defensive players and vice versa, all of that has to help, right?"

As I recall, I freely admitted it not being a Cowboys post, that my posts and comments were infrequent, and that it was something I felt strongly about. My fears for my wife and daughter, both healthcare professionals in hospitals, were openly shared, especially when at the time the essential PPE was not available. The swift elevation of infections and deaths was a by product of our unpreparedness and a learning curve of how this virus worked. Looking back to April seems like a lifetime ago, and for 240,000 Americans it literally was a lifetime ago. The rest of the country is now experiencing the full weight of this virus, it‚Äôs negligent handling, and the distant denial so easily adopted when bad news is only viewed on TV and not faced personally. Sadly, and frustratingly, we are entering another terrifying phase. Healthcare workers and their families are severely tested and many were broken during the crisis in our area earlier this year, some paid with their lives. I pray for all of the hospital healthcare workers across the nation as they confront the fury of this virus. My wife has been preparing her clinical staff to face another surge here on Long Island. It will be difficult for everyone. The physical, mental, and emotional toll it has taken on my loved ones since April is shocking, yet they must still fight the fight, and shortages of essential equipment still exist. This country is in dire straights. Looking back on the comments I posted on April 2nd (below) has frightened me because it is now nationwide, not just in the NY metro area. I don‚Äôt know if any of you remember my original post, but I‚Äôm sure it seemed like it was only a NY problem that would never reach you. Be safe, keep your family safe, and wear a mask.From NY with Love And AngerThanks so much for all of your well wishes and contact info for supplies. The outreach from good folks all over is such a comfort. I love the people on this site. There are so many courageous people on the front line that are friends and colleagues of my family. Honestly, the conference calls I overhear in the off hours at home between my wife and the CDC, the State Board of Health, the Governors office, the Hospital Administrators, and her own staff are frightening. Please just realize that this virus is serious business, clinically, biologically, it‚Äôs epidemiology, it‚Äôs mortality. The logistics facing overwhelmed hospitals and their staffs is not a function of government preparedness. Finger pointing is useless and at this point pathetic. Space is an issue for all patients, not just Covid-19. All the support systems, equipment, drugs, IV and chemo Hoods, costs, amount of staff to cover all the additional beds being added in different locations, it is a monumental task and she is only one hospital system, among the many in the NY metro area. Please be safe, take precautions seriously. God bless.commented by Tony_in_NY, Apr 2, 2020, 7:28pm PDTAnother user-created commentary provided by a BTB reader."

The coach met with the media today to update everyone on the status of the Cowboys. (All answers are paraphrased and not actual quotes).The Dallas Cowboys have had discussions about the creation of a bubble for the staff as far as combatting Covid-19 is concerned. Mike McCarthy noted that the Cowboys obviously have the resources with the Omni Hotel being connected to The Star and that this has been a constant conversation with Jerry Jones, Stephen Jones, Will McClay, and Todd Williams. He noted the center of those talks have been about how the team can improve especially around the coaching staff and their families and the program of testing.McCarthy noted that Will McClay‚Äôs staff is hard at work in preparations of the draft and they are having meetings with the scouts who are off-site.McCarthy said that both Andy Dalton and Tyrone Crawford will be activated to the team‚Äôs roster today. Dalton is coming back from both being in the concussion protocol and on the Reserve/COVID-19 list, Crawford was only on the latter.McCarthy noted that Minnesota does a great job of committing to the run and that you can see how comfortable Dalvin Cook is in Gary Kubiak‚Äôs system. He added that the Vikings do a great job with the keep and boot game off of their run prowess and noted that stopping them will be a challenge. He also complimented the speed that they utilize the wide zone run game.Andy Dalton is the primary backup quarterback for the Cowboys so it is possible that parts of the playbook open up with his return considering that he has had a lot more time to work with the team than say Garrett Gilbert did. McCarthy noted that while this is true in theory and that there is a larger ‚Äúmenu‚Äù to pick from the focus is consistency.Coach said that offensive tackle Brandon Knight will practice on Wednesday, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that he will necessarily be active any time in the immediate future. He has a 21-day window to be put back on the roster.McCarthy said that Biadasz is progressing from his injury but they won‚Äôt know anything until later this week as they work on offensive line combinations.Coach noted that Zimmer obviously puts together great defenses and that his players all play the same way which is a real credit to his coaching style.Another familiar face is back with the Cowboys in Ron‚ÄôDell Carter and McCarthy said that he is a great fit for what they want to do on the defensive front. He likes his versatility along the line and his ability to play multiple techniques. He said Carter brought a pass rush game with him from college.McCarthy noted that the Cowboys have gone back and looked back at everything that has happened to this point. He noted that the Cowboys have two glaring negatives as a football team, penalties and the turnover differential. He talked about how you continue to emphasize this and plan around it in a given week, but that at the end of the day all players need to try and create positive opportunities. He also added that the Cowboys - and everyone else in the world - are operating in extremely unprecedented times and that he is proud of how his players continue to bring energy week in and week out.Things are going to happen quickly for the Cowboys over the next week as they will play the Washington Football Team on Thanksgiving Day after their Minnesota game. Asked if the Cowboys would have another punter around to prepare for things he noted he did not have any specifics.Coach noted that Diggs will be placed on IR."

He‚Äôs also off the reserved/Covid-19 list.With that, the veteran quarterback was back at practice Monday at Ford Center in The Star.The Cowboys returned from a week off during their much-needed bye week and started preparation for next Sunday‚Äôs game in Minnesota.‚ÄúHe was cleared to participate in practice,‚Äù head coach Mike McCarthy said of Dalton. ‚ÄúHe had a good day. We had a mock game type of practice. And he was a full participant.‚ÄùA health update on a couple of vets.Crawford, a regular part of the defensive line rotation, has eight tackles and ranks fourth on defense with nine quarterback pressures.‚ÄúI‚Äôm hopeful it‚Äôs not too much longer, but I do not have an exact date,‚Äù McCarthy said regarding a timetable for Crawford‚Äôs return.Elsewhere on the roster, McCarthy said cornerback Chidobe Awuzie is pointing toward a return to game action after being activated from Reserve/Injured last week.Awuzie hurt his hamstring in Week 2 against Atlanta and hasn‚Äôt made a game appearance since.‚ÄúHe practiced today and he looks great, so I anticipate him being ready to go,‚Äù McCarthy said.More speculation on Ezekiel Elliott‚Äôs future.But Elliott‚Äôs backup, Tony Pollard‚Äìalso running behind that same line‚Äìaverages 4.4 yards a carry, which is over a half yard better than Elliott‚Äôs 3.8. And while the fumbles have been cleaned up, they certainly didn‚Äôt do anything to help while the Cowboys were playing from massive deficits earlier this season.There‚Äôs also the lack of yardage after contact. Elliott used to shake tacklers loose and make guys miss. He simply doesn‚Äôt do that anymore. He doesn‚Äôt appear to be fighting through an injury, save for the wonky hamstring that was giving him trouble last week. So it does beg the question: is Ezekiel Elliott already washed up?If he is, then that‚Äôs a massive problem. It‚Äôs not just because he‚Äôs looked upon to be a team leader. It‚Äôs because of that ridiculous contract extension he signed prior to last season. Of course, the absurd amount of money the Cowboys sunk into Elliott isn‚Äôt his fault. He‚Äôs within his right to seek every nickel coming to him. It‚Äôs just that the conventional wisdom is that you do not pay running backs that kind of cash. A player must be transcendent to be worth that kind of investment, and as good as Zeke has been for large stretches of his career, the Cowboys had no business shelling out that much money to a player who already has as much mileage on his tires as Elliott.The Vikings running game is on point.Offensively it‚Äôs been a weird, but productive year for the Vikings. Minnesota ranks 7th in offensive DVOA and 8th overall in EPA per play this season, led by Dalvin Cook and their dynamic rushing attack. Cook is already on the verge of 1,000 yards rushing this season, and has scored 12 rushing touchdowns through 8 games. Insane.Quarterback Kirk Cousins is still‚Ä¶Kirk Cousins. Overall he can be an efficient quarterback operating within a play action passing offense, but when asked to do to much as a dropback passer we‚Äôve seen him fail time and time again.Not for a lack of weapons, though.The numbers show just how good of a year Dak Prescott was having.While Prescott deserves credit for his strong numbers in 2020, his immense yardage total was a result of the Cowboys‚Äô porous defense. Dallas gave up at least 34 points in four of the team‚Äôs first five games. Prescott had to throw the ball to keep the Cowboys in those games.Though he did his part, it didn‚Äôt lead to many wins. The Cowboys went 2-3 under Prescott to open the season. While that‚Äôs not impressive, the team has been much worse without Prescott, going 0-4 in the four games since Prescott dislocated his ankle.Dallas‚Äô struggles could help Prescott in the long run. He‚Äôll be a free agent at the end of the season and is eligible for the franchise tag one more time. The Cowboys, however, could commit to Prescott long-term by signing him to a massive extension. Either move will be a tough decision with Prescott coming off the injury.Never a bad thing to at least kick the tires on a former first-round pick.The Dallas Cowboys could be a logical destination and one of the interested parties in adding DeAndre Baker. With Trevon Diggs out 4 to 6 weeks and possibly the rest of the year with a broken foot the Cowboys could use more CB depth this season. But, Baker could possibly be part of their future as well.This would be one of those risk/reward type of situations the Dallas Cowboys have had no problem justifying in the past. It worked out with Aldon Smith this season and could possibly work again with DeAndre Baker. I don‚Äôt know about you, but it sounds like a win-win to me.Of course, like everything it‚Äôs going to come down to money. Another team could be willing to offer Baker more than what the Cowboys could, but that shouldn‚Äôt stop them from at least trying. We all know they need more CB help beyond the 2020 season and DeAndre could potentially scratch that ‚Äúneed‚Äù off the list.The pairing of Trysten Hill and Neville Gallimore could be productive in the future.Dallas Cowboys: Neville Gallimore‚Äôs motor is revvingWhen you read his scouting reports, you would notice a couple of positive notes. People raved about his competitiveness and his workhorse mentality. Joe Marino of The Draft Network was one of those raving about Gallimore‚Äôs hustle.‚ÄúSome really impressive reps of secondary effort and making plays simply on account of hustle.‚ÄùWe saw that level of competitiveness against the Steelers. He was so impressive that if you google his name, you will see a ton of articles raving about his performance and his potential. Well, add this article to the list.While there aren‚Äôt many ‚Äúgreat‚Äù interior linemen in the NFL, those that are in that category get praised. They have a large role in a team‚Äôs run defense and can make a quarterback very uncomfortable.Most interior linemen specialize in either run-stuffing or pass rushing. Gallimore showed success in both areas despite not sacking Roethlisberger.The Dallas Cowboys have had a poor run defense for a couple of years now, in part because of the lack of stud players at defensive tackle. If Gallimore develops as those writing articles praising him and I believe, then it will help solidify the Cowboys‚Äô defense.We keep moving on up.1. New York Jets2. Jacksonville3. Dallas4.

All they have to do is just cruise through the rest of the schedule and take a high, possibly top five, pick into the 2021 NFL draft. Right?Well, maybe not. It turns out that Dallas has the easiest path to a playoff berth in the landfill conflagration that is the NFC East. With their division rivals all also well below .500, getting a premium pick may be harder than it would seem. That‚Äôs because the other challengers face more daunting schedules. Here are the remaining opponents for the worst division in the NFL, in order.The Cowboys only have one team remaining on the schedule that has a winning record, the Baltimore Ravens. The New York Giants have a four game stretch against 6-3 teams that are all fighting for playoff spots. For the Philadelphia Eagles, it is even worse, as they have the next five weeks against teams that are 6-3 or better. Only the fighting Washington Football Team has anything close to what Dallas faces, and they still have to get through the Seattle Seahawks and the undefeated Pittsburgh Steelers.Of course, the Cowboys haven‚Äôt exactly proven that they can overcome teams that are struggling. This week‚Äôs matchup with the Minnesota Vikings is shaping up to be a crucial indicator of what they might be able to accomplish the rest of the way. Dallas‚Äô defense has gelled the past couple of games, and how they do against Kirk Cousins, Dalvin Cook, and the rest of the Minnesota offense will have a lot to do with whether the Cowboys have a chance.Then there is the question of quarterback. Mike McCarthy is still mulling over whether Andy Dalton or Garrett Gilbert starts, but neither is at the moment a proven quantity. Yes, Dalton had a lot of wins with the Cincinnati Bengals, but he did not look at all good in his first two starts for Dallas. Gilbert may or may not have been a flash in the pan. But one positive sign is that the offensive line has been gradually figuring some things out. It still has issues, particularly with Terence Steele. Connor Williams also has had his struggles. Still, things are looking a bit better, and Gilbert was only sacked twice against the Steelers, while the running game had 144 yards in a game that came much closer to being a huge upset than we imagined beforehand.If the QB situation works out, whoever is taking the snaps, then that is not at all a daunting slate ahead, and the Cowboys have a rematch with all three division rivals coming.The Football Team may be the most challenging. Alex Smith was impressive in his first start since his devastating injury, amassing 390 yards in their narrow loss to the Detroit Lions. He still lives and dies by the short pass, but Dallas has been quite vulnerable to those in the earlier games. They have the fighting Teams up after the Vikings. By then, we will know if they are a real contender to represent the NFCE in the playoffs, even with a weak record, or if we can go back to arguing about trading back or trying to take a highly-ranked draftee.After the Team, the next biggest threat looks to be the Giants. Daniel Jones is starting to figure out the complex and innovative Jason Garrett offense. (Sarcasm very much intended.) They got their second and third wins of the year, both within the division, before their bye this week, and have already swept Washington. That gives them something to build on. The question is just how badly that will be damaged by that four game stretch after they play the Bengals.The Eagles are frankly in trouble. Carson Wentz has looked bad, and his performance in the loss to the Lions was perhaps his worst of the season. With the next five games in a row against teams solidly in the playoff mix, they may be just about done by the time they get to the final two division contests.The last two weeks also have Dallas playing their rivals, Philadelphia in the next to last game, then finishing against the Giants. If they come into that final pair of contests having gotten just a few wins along the way, they could well be playing for the chance to keep going into January.That would obviously torpedo their shot at a high draft pick. It could hurt their opportunities to stock up on good rookies, but this year‚Äôs draft class is shaping up to be weak on blue-chip players. Making the playoffs, even if they are one and done, could still pay some dividends. It would be a remarkable accomplishment with the long, long list of starters lost to injury this season, with Dak Prescott the biggest. That would instill a sense of confidence in returning players, and build faith in what the coaches are trying to do.It still is ludicrous to be talking about being in the mix for a playoff spot at 2-7. But that is where we are. And in some ways, it does make things much more interesting, whichever way you would prefer the season to end."

However, when viewed ‚Äî and paid like ‚Äî one of the best players at a given position, it‚Äôs assumed he‚Äôs still going to thrive in areas where he has greater control.Elliott hasn‚Äôt been a disappointment this season because he‚Äôs averaging the least rushing yards per carry and game of his career, or because he‚Äôs failed to generate 100 rushing yards in a single game this season ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to explain those away due to Dallas‚Äô issues up front. He‚Äôs been a disappointment largely because he hasn‚Äôt gotten the job done even in instances when you can isolate his performance from those around him. He leads the league in drops (six) and fumbles (five) among RBs this season, per Pro Football Focus, which are both areas where Elliott has greater control. Yet, Elliott has still struggled with consistency.While he‚Äôs typically one of the best backs in pass protection, Elliott has also been a little more inconsistent there than in previous years, allowing the most pressures (nine) in pass protection among all RBs and possessing the fifth-worst pass-blocking efficiency among the 17 RBs who are consistently relied upon in pass protection (at least 170 snaps in pass protection this season), per PFF. In only nine games this year, Elliott has already more pressures than any other year in his career outside of 2019 (13), a total he‚Äôs on pace to break this season. While he‚Äôs had some truly impressive performances in pass protection this season (notably against Seattle), he‚Äôs also had way too many instances where he‚Äôs not getting the job done either.Although Elliott hasn‚Äôt been gifted with as many open running lanes as in the past, when he does get good blocking, he hasn‚Äôt done a great job of taking advantage, struggling to consistently break tackles or make defenders miss when one-on-one in the open field. Elliott is averaging the least yards after contact per carry (2.61) of his career this season and ranks 35th among RBs in elusive rating (39.3), per PFF.There‚Äôs a lot going on here...FRISCO - The Dallas Cowboys‚Äô claim of ‚Äúturning down offers‚Äô‚Äô for Aldon Smith just before the NFL Trade Deadline is the stuff that future negotiations are made of.The claim makes it much easier for ownership to attempt to extend or re-sign the ‚Äúrescue-project‚Äô‚Äô Smith to a new deal for 2021 and beyond, the Joneses being able to say, ‚ÄúNot only did we give you a second chance in the NFL, but we believe in you so strongly that we wouldn‚Äôt even listen to trade offers!‚Äô‚ÄôBut there is some mythology here that gets in the way of the facts, and some truths here that make an Aldon Smith re-signing more complicated than it seems.Did the Cowboys really turn down offers for Smith? The buzz we hear is that the Seattle Seahawks are the only team that made an offer - and that their proposal included only a ‚Äúmid-round pick.‚Äô‚ÄôGiven the fact that if Smith leaves after 2020, the Cowboys will likely receive a compensatory selection worth the same ‚Äúmid-round pick,‚Äô‚Äô Dallas hardly demonstrated any ‚Äúspecial devotion‚Äô‚Äô to the player by spurning the offer.Keep your eyes peeled soldiers.TCU at West Virginia, 11:00am CT, FOXMuch like the Cowboys‚Äô draft focus in 2021 should be, let‚Äôs focus in on some defensive prospects in this Big 12 battle in Morgantown. TCU has a pair of safeties in Moehrig and Washington that are extremely physical and patrol the middle of the field nicely in a heavy passing league. And while the bigger name prospects from the Mountaineers have mostly come on offense, it‚Äôs been ‚Äòalmost heaven‚Äô in West Virginia for defensive players lately. Karl Joseph in Cleveland, Kyzir White with the Chargers, and Nick Kwaitkoski are all starters in the league and have paved the way for West Virginia to be a destination for defensive prospects.Trevon Moehrig, TCU (Safety) - Quite possibly a top-5 safety in this year‚Äôs class, Moehrig showcases incredible athleticism and frame for the safety position. His aggressiveness can sometimes get him in trouble but has the sideline-to-sideline ability that you want to see from a centerfield. Had his first interception of the season last week in the win over Texas Tech. Early Projection: Mid 2nd RoundAr‚ÄôDarius Washington, TCU (Safety) ‚Äì Just a redshirt sophomore, Washington has a lot of growth to go from a play recognition standpoint and is stalled way too often on play-action and misdirection to be classified as a ‚Äòquick trigger.‚Äô However, his instincts and production make me seriously doubt he‚Äôll return to Fort Worth next season despite taking a step back from an incredible 2019 season. He may be as fun of a safety to watch and a prospect that has an unbelievably high ceiling at the position. Early Projection: Late 3rd RoundWill the Cowboys look at quarterbacks with their potential top five pick?Not lost in that discussion is the fact that Dallas is 2-7 and would have the No. 3 pick in the NFL Draft if the season ended on Friday. The possibility of the team moving on from Prescott and selecting a quarterback, whether it is Justin Fields or Trevor Lawrence, is certainly in the realm of possibilities.But for ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper Jr., the choice is clear: Trade the pick and improve the team in other areas while retaining Prescott.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not talking about a young quarterback who is unproven, who is still going through those rough starts and inconsistency,‚Äù he recently said on ESPN‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Up‚Äù, according to 247Sports.com. ‚ÄúDak is a heck of a quarterback and you can get an awful lot ‚Äî you can get a tremendous amount in return for a pick that represents Trevor Lawrence or Justin Fields. That‚Äôs got to be under consideration here.‚ÄùVintage John Fassel came to play in week nine, will he show back up in Minnesota?What we expected: The Cowboys could only upgrade at punt returner from Tavon Austin, who seemed entirely disinterested in the role last season. Lamb returned 54 punts at Oklahoma and was the favorite to replace him. Pollard represented a wild card at kick returner, having not consistently demonstrated a strong feel for the role as a rookie.What happened: Lamb has provided a nice spark at times, but the juice may not be worth the squeeze when it comes to exposing the dynamic first-round pick to potential injury. Wilson is sure-handed and offers a nice arm, too. He threw a cross-field lateral Sunday to cornerback C.J. Goodwin on a punt, producing a 73-yard gain. Pollard botched a kickoff return to start a drive at the Cowboys‚Äô own 1-yard line in Week 3. That led to a safety.What we‚Äôd like to see now: Fassel‚Äôs creativity is the best asset in Dallas‚Äô return game. Be it laterals, misdirection or otherwise, he is encouraged to keep his foot on the pedal. Barring a tightening in the NFC East standings, it may be best for Wilson, not Lamb, to close the year at punt returner. There is no obvious upgrade for Pollard on the kickoff return team.Play the kids!Rob Phillips: Fifth-round draft pick Bradlee Anae has played only six defensive snaps this season, and he was inactive against the Steelers. I‚Äôm all for giving Randy Gregory a ton of playing time ‚Äî he was really active with five pressures last Sunday ‚Äî but I‚Äôd like to see what Anae can do with a few snaps in the rotation. With Everson Griffen now in Detroit, there could be ways to work Anae into the lineup. He‚Äôs a skilled pass rusher, and perhaps most important at that position, he‚Äôs got a terrific motor.Kyle Youmans: BRADLEE ANAE PLEASE. It‚Äôs been nine weeks now and each week I plead to the coaching staff to see significant snaps for Anae who has six on the year and three different forms of pressure in just those six snaps. He plays well on special teams, doesn‚Äôt have Everson Griffen in his way anymore, yet he can‚Äôt find his way on to the active roster. The rookie is a gamer. He had double-digit sacks last year for Utah and the tape got him to the NFL despite scouts everywhere asking ‚Äúwhere does the production come from?‚Äù He‚Äôs a poor practice player, which may be why he doesn‚Äôt see the snaps, but I want to see the rook get a significant chance.BTB Podcast ScheduleWe also offer daily episodes of The Ocho where we give you that day‚Äôs latest headlines so that you always stay caught up.

That was the year they said goodbye to players like Brandon Carr, Morris Claiborne, Barry Church and J.J. Wilcox. They headed into the draft and spent a second-round pick on Chidobe Awuzie, a third-round pick on Jourdan Lewis, and a sixth-round pick on Xavier Woods. Boom, instant makeover.Now, they might have to do it again. All three of those players taken in the 2017 draft - Awuzie, Lewis and Woods - are scheduled to be unrestricted free agents this upcoming offseason. The Cowboys have already made some strides in bringing in young talent; Trevon Diggs looks like a keeper at corner, and Donovan Wilson is seeing some time at safety and doesn‚Äôt look too out of place.They also picked up Reggie Robinson in the draft, but so far he has yet to see the field. Here was Jerry Jones‚Äô take on him from a few days ago.Why doesn‚Äôt Reggie Robinson play? With Trevon Diggs injured, will he see time at cornerback or is he strictly a safetyJones: ‚ÄúThe facts are that that needs to stay a question, just like you‚Äôre talking about. Young guy needs to be able to focus more. He needs less position flex activity, a younger guy. On the other hand, he has the ability to help us across the secondary. But your point is, sure, that‚Äôs what the loss of Diggs, the spot, the number coming available. That‚Äôs what it does to you, and you play those guys, and then those guys are all of a sudden just better for having played the game. I know you ‚Äî why it doesn‚Äôt happen is because usually you think the situation is just not worthy of the mistakes that a young makes, And, so, you go to the experience side. It‚Äôs overall in the best interest of the team to play the inexperience overall. But you want the inexperience to not screw it up.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs a word salad extraordinaire even for Jerry Jones. But what he seems to be saying is that Robinson just isn‚Äôt ready yet. Basically it sounds like he needs a red-shirt year.Jones was also asked about Awuzie and Lewis.What you looking for out of Chidobe Awuzie and Jourdan Lewis for the rest of the year?Jones: ‚ÄúThose are real ‚Äî those are very pointed areas that we must look at. We must look at our style of play. We have to look at availability. We have to ‚Äî we have changed to some degree what we expect a D-back to give us out there. All of that has really shows up and has shown up. This is when we take advantage of it. It goes right to a Robinson question or these guys that have more experience. Now, let me just say this. Both those guys you just mentioned, I can you tell you right now, if they‚Äôre healthy and available they need to be out there. They can help us make the plays we want to make down the stretch here.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs interesting that Jones said we must look at the style of play. He seems to be saying there is a real debate about whether those two corners fit what the Cowboys hope to be doing going forward in their new defensive scheme.Which brings us back to 2021 free agency. Are Awuzie, Lewis or Woods even worth putting up free agent money for? Obviously if they want to sign a cheap deal that is one thing, but should the Cowboys make a real play for them or wait to see if they are around in the second/third waves of free agency.What‚Äôs your call BTB? Would you pursue any of those three to re-sign this offseason?"

On Wednesday, we looked over the performance of the running backs and determined that the Cowboys should be giving Tony Pollard more of Ezekiel Elliott‚Äôs workload.Today, we‚Äôre going to go discuss the play of Sunday‚Äôs starting quarterback, Garrett Gilbert, as we make an argument that...The Cowboys offense showed a little life on Sunday thanks to the play of their fourth-string quarterback. Garrett Gilbert finished the game hitting 21 of 38 passing attempts for a total of 243 yards. He had a nice touchdown pass to CeeDee Lamb as well as costly, ill-advised fluttering toss to the end zone that was intercepted. In all, it was solid performance by the backup quarterback.The Cowboys have a bye this week, and should be getting a healthy, COVID-free Andy Dalton back by the time they‚Äôre set to play the Minnesota Vikings in Week 11. This raises the question of who will be the team‚Äôs starting quarterback then? Stephen Jones appears to have already answered that question.Cowboys VP Stephen Jones on @1053thefan said he thought Garrett Gilbert had a ‚Äúhell of a day‚Äù and gave them ‚Äúevery opportunity to win‚Äù against the Steelers. But Andy Dalton will be Dallas‚Äô starting QB when he returns from the reserve/COVID-19 listThis is a little surprising considering how well Gilbert played on Sunday. There were a lot of things to like about his performance. He did a very good job sitting in the pocket, and looked very comfortable throwing the football. There were a handful of moments where the ball sailed, and some of that should be expected when you take into account he‚Äôs had so little time to get a feel for his receivers. Despite those misfires, his collective body of work was pretty good.One of the things that stood out the most was how decisive he was throwing the ball. He didn‚Äôt linger in the pocket unsure of where he wanted to go with the ball. His quick decisions actually made the offensive line look pretty good. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the line was great, but Gilbert‚Äôs ability to get rid of the ball in a timely manner was the perfect remedy for a backup offensive line that is only capable of holding off the pressure for so long. Check out some of his quick decisions and how he was able to stay in rhythm.Gilbert displayed nice footwork on Sunday; sometimes subtle, other times more elaborate. The bounce in his step allowed him to re-direct quickly as he did a great job pointing his ‚Äúankle eye‚Äù in the direction of his receiving target. His happy feet also allowed him to always be ready to deliver the ball even when he wasn‚Äôt complete set.He was very poised in the pocket as he didn‚Äôt seem skittish when things started to break down. Gilbert just stayed calm and delivered the ball. On those instances he did bail, he did very nice job throwing on the run. This is the type of playmaking quarterback the Cowboys need behind center in Dak Prescott‚Äôs absence as it gives the team their best chance to utilize their offensive weapons.CONCLUSIONIt‚Äôs hard to make sense of what Stephen Jones‚Äô logic is by going back to Andy Dalton. Sure, they did fork out $3 million in insurance money for Dalton‚Äôs services that could even cost them a little more if he plays a certain percentage of the snaps (which is doable) and the team makes the playoffs (which is highly unlikely), so we can see how they‚Äôd want to get their money‚Äôs worth. But at the same time, does Dalton offer them the best chance for success?With Gilbert under center, they stand a better chance to utilize their offensive weapons, which is important for the development of players like CeeDee Lamb and Dalton Schultz. Keeping the ball moving means more reps for Tyler Biadasz or any of the young offensive linemen looking to carve out a role next season. With Dalton, you know what you‚Äôre getting and he‚Äôs fine, but with Gilbert comes the opportunity for something more. And let us not forget that the team will be on the look out for a backup QB next season, so why not see if Gilbert is someone who could fill that role?We also wanted to highlight some good performances by a couple defensive linemen...The Cowboys defensive tackles started the season with so much promise, and none of it worked out how we thought. Free agent acquisition Gerald McCoy got hurt in training camp and never saw the field. Free agent Dontari Poe was largely disappointing to where he was released after seven games. And even the good news didn‚Äôt stay good for long as second-year player Trysten Hill was having a nice season before suffering a season-ending injury in Week 5 against the Giants.While not having having these guys hurts the unit, it opened the door for more opportunities for third-round rookie Neville Gallimore. Playing in 36 defensive snaps on Sunday, the rook had the best game of his young career.Neville Gallimore recorded his 2nd career start on Sunday and had a breakthrough performance as a run defender:

-Run Defense Grade: 80.7 (ranked 7th among DTs)
-Run Stops: 3 (ranked t-6th)
-Run Stop %: 18.8% (ranked t-5th)#Cowboys pic.twitter.com/z4DETfX7o4Gallimore showed up on tape a lot as he was overpowering blockers at the point off attack. Multiple times in the game he pushed through the creases and into the backfield. His strong hands were on display as once he latched on to the ball carrier, it was over. And if the got a clean shot at them, he just threw him to the ground. Let‚Äôs look at him in action.Here are the same plays at a different angle with things slowed down a bit.Not only did Gallimore have himself a great game, but Randy Gregory continues to get better. After playing only six defensive snaps in his season debut against Washington, he‚Äôs now tallied 31 and 40 snaps respectively over the past two games. His skills were all over the tape as he demonstrated a lot of power pushing his blockers backwards and did a great job using his hands to fight through creases.Here are the same plays at a different angle with things slowed down a bit.Both Gallimore and Gregory showed up big on those fourth down stops.Let‚Äôs slow it down..."

Of course, that accolade that comes courtesy of their bye week. Make no mistake about it, this Cowboys team isn‚Äôt playing winning football right now. And when you consider a big part of that is the unfortunate health of the squad, there will be no corner turned as there is no sign of improvements coming. Check out the extent of the Cowboys injuries this season:And that doesn‚Äôt even include the time missed for defensive starters Leighton Vander Esch (four games) and Anthony Brown (three games) or the three games missed by offensive line backups Brandon Knight and Joe Looney. Things have been bad. Really bad.That places this current Cowboys team in a precarious situation for the remainder of the season. We‚Äôve all come to terms that this season isn‚Äôt going anywhere, so let‚Äôs grab a ticket to the organic tanking show that will reward this team with a top 10 draft pick. In fact, the Cowboys currently hold the no. 3 position for the 2021 NFL draft order.While it‚Äôs unclear where this team ultimately finishes, it‚Äôs clearly evident that they‚Äôre going to get a shot at one of the top collegiate players in the nation come April. As the level of suckitude increases, the team gradually starts positioning themselves in a landing spot that could put them in play for the ‚Äúarms race‚Äù that happens every year when bad teams have an opportunity to draft one of those highly-coveted top college quarterbacks.The Cowboys, however, don‚Äôt need a new quarterback. They have Dak Prescott. Or should we say, they soon will have Prescott once his long-term extension is signed.Even though the quarterback situation in Dallas appears to be pretty cut and dry, it‚Äôs hard to get away from at least pondering what it would look like if the team drafted one of the top quarterbacks coming out of college, so that is what we‚Äôre going to do here.Currently, there are three quarterbacks who stand to be hot commodities on draft day - Clemson‚Äôs Trevor Lawrence (projected to be the no. 1 overall pick), Ohio State‚Äôs Justin Fields, and North Dakota State‚Äôs Trey Lance. Playing along with this hypothetical, if the Cowboys land in one of the top draft spots to secure a player they absolutely love, then what?Prescott get‚Äôs taggedThe Cowboys organization should have a good feel for what they plan to do by the time free agency rolls around in mid-March of next year. There is a super-small chance they get a long-term deal worked out with Prescott before then, but the Cowboys could place a second franchise tag on him to prevent him from hitting the open market. The front office will have to work a bit to free up the cap space to do it, but that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. On paper, the Cowboys will have to account for a $37.7 million cap hit for 2021. The clock, once again, will start for them to work out a long-term deal before the July deadline.Trade him or lose himIf the Cowboys intended to use their first-round pick on a quarterback, then they would need to find a way to trade Prescott to avoid just flat out losing him after the 2021 season. The optimal scenario would be deal him away to another team that really wants Dak as their quarterback. There would be a lot of behind the scenes negotiations as well as financial finagling going on to swing such a deal, but if they pulled it off, here is what the Cowboys would gain:*denotes removing Prescott‚Äôs annual cost of $40 million and adding on a new rookie deal of about $9 million annuallyThe additional draft capital combined with over $120 million in cap savings over the next four seasons creates a package that would be very appealing if it also included a talented young star quarterback. And that‚Äôs the reason we can‚Äôt just completely discount the idea all together. However, once they ponder it over, hopefully they‚Äôll understand...The driving force behind what the Cowboys actually do will come down to how they feel about their choices. If they felt they were getting the league‚Äôs next star quarterback, then that‚Äôs the way to go, right?No.They have the league‚Äôs next star quarterback already. Is it possible a player they could select might turn out better than Prescott? Sure. It‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs also highly unlikely. What looks fantastic coming out of college, doesn‚Äôt always translate to the NFL level. Let‚Äôs take a look at the last ten quarterbacks drafted within the top three picks of the draft.What quarterbacks from that list would you want to have over Dak Prescott? At most, you might say Kyler Murray and/or Joe Burrow, and that‚Äôs only because what we‚Äôve seen of them thus far is mostly good. There are a lot of young quarterbacks that start out with a lot of promise, but that doesn‚Äôt guarantee great things later. If the Cowboys hit the reset button at quarterback and went with a brand new college star, they would be taking a huge amount of risk.The Cowboys know what they have with Dak. And after watching this team play with three different backup quarterbacks their past four games, they also know what they have without him. Rather than using that golden draft capital on a new quarterback, they should use it instead to add pieces around him, like say, on defense? Wouldn‚Äôt the thought of adding a top defensive player like Penn State linebacker Micah Parsons or Alabama cornerback Patrick Surtain make you feel better about the collective state of this roster? And if the Cowboys do end up in one of the top quarterback spots, they can just as easily trade out of it for extra draft picks with a team that is much more quarterback hungry.It‚Äôs always good to lay everything out on the table so they can make a decision that is best for the team, but when it‚Äôs all said and done, that decision is going to include keeping no. 4 behind center for years to come."

But one consistent topic of the week has been the play of Jaylon Smith over the first half of the season.‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a player out there that doesn‚Äôt have things that he doesn‚Äôt want to improve on and can be better,‚Äù said Cowboys owner/general manager Jerry Jones. ‚ÄúBut, boy, I‚Äôm glad we got him. He‚Äôs one of our cornerstones and he‚Äôll get better and better and better.‚ÄùSmith‚Äôs level of play has been a hot button issue, to put it mildly, and Jones‚Äô quote encapsulates the point. A simple glance at the stats will tell you that his 89 tackles leads the team and is currently second-best in the entire NFL. And obviously, his $68 million contract makes him one of the more crucial figures on the Dallas defense.At the same time, some simple tape review confirms that it‚Äôs been a bumpy season for Smith. The 2019 Pro Bowler has struggled with assignments and tackling at times. During Sundays‚Äô inspired effort against Pittsburgh, he was hit with two crucial penalties that ‚Äì while perhaps dubious ‚Äì helped swing the outcome of the game.Center Tyler Biadasz makes this list almost by default. But CeeDee Lamb is beat out by Tee Higgins and Justin Jefferson? Trevon Diggs is beat out by A.J. Terrell and Jaylon Johnson.C TYLER BIADASZ, DALLAS COWBOYSThere have only been two starting centers in this rookie class, and Biadasz has been the better of the two. However, that‚Äôs not saying much, as he‚Äôs only earned a 53.3 overall grade and allowed multiple pressures in three of his six starts.Dalton Schultz is going to make things interesting when Blake Jarwin returns in 2021.In his first start against Atlanta in Week 2, he had career highs in receptions (9) and yards (88) while also recording his first career touchdown. He then had four catches for 72 yards and another score in Week 4 against Cleveland. Coming out of the bye week, he already had 35 grabs for 383 yards overall, both of which were easily personal bests.Jarwin was signed to a contract extension prior to the 2020 season and is under contract until 2024. Schultz is on his rookie deal that runs through 2021. Based on his first three seasons, he knows it‚Äôs best to focus on what happens on the field.‚ÄúAll I can do is do my best to be ready to take advantage of any opportunity,‚Äù Schultz says. ‚ÄúI need to just continue to put in as much work as I can.‚ÄùWhich if this year is any indication, means the Cowboys‚Äô tight end situation will still be in good hands.A look at how the offense has performed and what they need to do going ahead. Here, a highlight of the WR section.What we expected: That the addition of Lamb would make this arguably the most explosive trio in the league. A 1,000-yard season for each of the top three receivers was more than a dream. It was within reach, especially given a frequent diet of early deficits that forced the Cowboys to the air often.What happened: This group got off to a fast start. All three made big plays. All three had a good rapport with Prescott. Then he went down, and the chemistry changed. There are games where one or two of these receivers do very little over the course of a game.What we‚Äôd like to see now: The promise of this group isn‚Äôt diminished. It‚Äôs just that expectations for the moment have been altered. Gallup has really been lost in the shuffle. He needs to get the ball more.The Cowboys former signal-caller, Troy Aikman, was very impressed with Garrett Gilbert.‚ÄúHe looked extremely confident, poised, thought he did some really good things. I liked what I saw of him,‚Äù former Cowboys quarterback and current Fox broadcaster Troy Aikman said during his weekly appearance with The Musers on 96.7 FM/1310 AM The Ticket [KTCK-AM] on Tuesday.‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs an older guy, he‚Äôs not your typical first-time-to-start age ‚Ä¶ but yeah I liked what he did. That was not an easy defense to go up against, and yet he hung in there.‚Äù...‚ÄúI had gone and spent a few days in Carolina a few years ago during the offseason, during their OTAs, and Garrett was with Carolina at that time, and had a chance to watch him and his command in the huddle,‚Äù Aikman said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a confident guy. I liked him then. I was actually surprised when he didn‚Äôt stay on Carolina‚Äôs roster relative to what I had seen those three days in OTAs.‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs kind of had the hard road ‚Äì a really acclaimed high school player, bounced around a little bit in college, things didn‚Äôt go quite the way he had hoped, they haven‚Äôt gone the way I‚Äôm sure he had hoped at the NFL level, as well. And I think that with that you develop some toughness and some resilience.‚ÄùA look ahead to the second half of the season for the Cowboys.Biggest question left to answer: Who are the defensive pieces to keep around in 2021? The offense will get Prescott, provided he is either given the franchise tag again or signed to a long-term deal, Smith, Collins and tight end Blake Jarwin (knee) back next season, so there is hope it can be a top unit next season. But the Cowboys‚Äô defense has holes everywhere. DeMarcus Lawrence is playing better, but the defensive end needs more sacks. Linebacker Jaylon Smith‚Äôs future with the team is in question because of his lack of performance and contract. Free-agents-to-be in the secondary, such as Xavier Woods, Jourdan Lewis and Chidobe Awuzie (who missed time with a hamstring injury), have not impressed. The Cowboys want to keep defensive end Aldon Smith, but he has to show he can play a full season after such a long layoff.Who is playing for his job in 2021? Coach Mike McCarthy is likely to get a grace period because of how strange this season has been. Defensive coordinator Mike Nolan will not. His unit is on pace to allow the most points in a season in franchise history, if not the most ever in an NFL season. The saving grace might be the remaining division games against offensively challenged teams such as the New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Football Team. Nolan brought a scheme to the Cowboys that was supposed to adapt to the personnel, but it has not done much of anything right, including stopping the run or creating turnovers. Unless there is a massive turnaround, the entire defensive staff could be in trouble.The Dak Prescott situation will be fun once the 2020 season ends.The Cowboys could be the most shocking team on the quarterback carousel this offseason‚Äîor they could be a non-participant.Prescott is the reason for the wide range of outcomes, and that was the case before a Week 5 ankle injury knocked him out for the remainder of the season.Dallas hit the 27-year-old with the franchise tag over the offseason, locking in one of the NFL‚Äôs best young passers for a season after both parties reportedly disagreed on the number of extension years.Now it seems like Prescott could get whatever he wants‚Äîin Dallas or otherwise. The Cowboys have flopped, going 0-4 without him and his eye-popping output. He completed 68 percent of his passes with 1,856 yards and nine touchdowns over just five games, dragging a historically incompetent defense with him.But the team‚Äôs win-now mode has backfired, and Dallas has roughly $35 million in free cap space for 2021. That‚Äôs before any leaguewide adjustments to the cap and what it will cost to keep Prescott. If it‚Äôs another tag, it‚Äôll be an escalation on his $31.4 cap hit from this season, and if it‚Äôs an extension, it‚Äôs a likely comparable number.Besides the cap situation, add in a 2-7 record likely giving the Cowboys a top-10 draft pick, and to say things are about to get interesting in Dallas would be a massive understatement.BTB Podcast ScheduleWe also offer daily episodes of The Ocho where we give you that day‚Äôs latest headlines so that you always stay caught up.

Let me explain why that matters.

The idea of tanking is that it gives the Cowboys (organization in Frisco) better draft picks, so they can replace some of their players with better players.But the people who will actually do the tanking are the players whom you want to replace.So when you suggest that ""the Cowboys"" tank, you are asking players to work specifically to lose their jobs.They aren‚Äôt going to do that.

No player is going to deliberately play badly in order to simultaneously
A. help the Cowboys hire their replacements, andB. screw up their tape so nobody else will hire them either.There are other issues, like coaches who don‚Äôt want to be fired, but the main issue is this:To the people who actually have to do it, ""tanking"" means playing badly enough that the Cowboys will replace them.I don't want to lose my job. I suspect that the football players don't want to lose their job eitherAnother user-created commentary provided by a BTB reader."

But that is not necessarily the case, because after so many weeks of wildly dysfunctional play, things actually seemed to come together in a good, though ultimately futile, showing against what is probably the best team they will play all year. While there were a lot of positives to examine in loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, one thing may be far more important than any other. It may have been the turning point for the coaching staff.For the first half of the season, the only thing the Cowboys seemed truly competent at was finding new ways to lose games. Outside of a miracle finish over the Atlanta Falcons and a narrow win against the New York Giants, both teams also in line for high draft picks, they just kept floundering. They barely held a lead at all in the first eight games.But against the Steelers, they led almost the entire game, from their first possession until Pittsburgh‚Äôs go ahead touchdown with just 2:14 left to play. It was a game where a couple of questionable penalties and no-calls could easily have turned the tide. One where it is not illogical to argue that Dallas was actually the best team on the field, despite fielding a quarterback with all of six NFL passes in his career, and what may be a historically long list of injured starters.Several players stepped up this game, including Garrett Gilbert, Tony Pollard, Neville Gallimore, and Donovan Wilson. And the receiving corps was its normally effective self. However, the key thing was how the coaching staff finally got such good performances out of the patchwork roster.Up until this game, many were declaring that there had to be a shakeup on the staff, with defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and special teams coordinator John Fassel the main targets of ire. Nolan‚Äôs players looked lost at times, and nothing seemed to work as opponents moved the ball and scored almost at will in some games. Meanwhile, there was no real contribution from STs, outside of Greg Zuerlein generally doing his job kicking field goals.But suddenly, the defense was getting stops all game. They limited the Steelers to only five of thirteen third down conversions, and stopped both fourth down attempts. Only some of those frustrating penalty calls saved the final game-winning drive for Pittsburgh. The biggest change was how they absolutely shut down the run. Gallimore was a big part of that, but it was also an entire team effort, with DeMarcus Lawrence again showing how his contributions go far beyond sacks. And while Ben Roethlisberger would eventually get enough touchdown passes to win the game, it would have been a different situation entirely if the refs had just been consistent on what was and wasn‚Äôt pass interference.Meanwhile, teams came up with not one, but two huge returns, the first of the entire season. Fassel pulled out a real surprise of a punt return play with the lateral from Cedrick Wilson to Oscar candidate C.J. Goodwin that came within a few yards of scoring, plus a silly foul that still left Dallas where they should have managed a touchdown. And Rico Dowdle had an electrifying kickoff return for 64 yards from the Dallas one-yard line. It was both an outstanding individual effort and great blocking from his teammates.All year, there has been dismay over how the players just did not seem to understand the new things both Nolan and Fassel were trying to put into effect. There were reports of discontent in the locker room over the complexity of the new defensive scheme, which was ironic given how predictability was seen as the downfall of the Rod Marinelli/Kris Richard approach. And Fassel was just not getting any production.Things had started to look up for the defense in the week eight loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, which was driven more by offensive ineptitude on Dallas‚Äô part. But the effort against the other Pennsylvania team was the first time things really started to click. Suddenly a lot of people were having to admit that maybe the problem was getting a new approach installed under the severe limitations imposed by the pandemic precautions, plus maybe some difficulty on the part of some players in absorbing and applying the new elements.As for special teams, we may overlook how there is often a boom and bust aspect. Few teams have big plays on a consistent basis, with kickers usually driving the ball too deep on kickoffs to return, and punters mostly doing a good job of making it hard to get returns, and the Cowboys have not given up any real daggers all season. Fassel has a reputation for a deep and varied bag of tricks, but plays like the Goodwin return require the right circumstances, in this case a punt to one corner to set up the lateral. Things finally aligned. The execution was not flawless as the lateral was almost too high and was bobbled for a heart-stopping moment, but it still was nearly a home run. Dowdle‚Äôs return was actually more encouraging. That was just good execution and hard running. It is the kind of thing that is far more repeatable. We can just hope they can do it more often. It was an unusual situation, coming on a kickoff from the fifty after a penalty on the previous Steelers score. They tried to get cute and pin the Cowboys with a high, short kick rather than just booming it out of the end zone. That may not happen again, but some kickoffs will be short enough to return, and now we know that something good is certainly possible.More importantly, now the players see that things are working. We can also include Kellen Moore‚Äôs offense in that, as he showed that he was able to plan and call a strong game even with a largely untried quantity like Gilbert. The job Joe Philbin has done with the constant shuffling of backups and not being completely overwhelmed on the offensive line also deserves credit. It still sees breakdowns, particularly as Terence Steele continues to struggle on many plays, but just to have a functioning offense is quite an accomplishment.Having success on defense and teams is a huge boost to the confidence of those units, and in the belief the players have to have in their coaches. That was shaky at best in the first half of the season, but the strong performance against the Steelers could pay big dividends, not just for the rest of this season, but into next year. This campaign is almost certainly going to end with Dallas sitting out the preseason. Now, however, the offseason should be one that the team can use to build on these signs of improvement. Any kind of regular offseason could see things come together even more than they have the past couple of games.No one gained more than the coaching staff last Sunday. It is something to look to when we need hope for the future of the Cowboys."

The NFC East is easily the worst division across the entire NFL this season, but thanks to the way that the playoff structure currently works somebody has to win it and whoever does will get to host a playoff game. Don‚Äôt forget about all of those fun hats and t-shirts.Week 10 brings a game between the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles and last time that the two met provided one of the more comical moments of the season with Daniel Jones tripping in the open field, but his team still almost found a way to win.Most people tend to believe that the Eagles are the favorite to win this division, and if they do it is possible that their front office believes them to be legitimate contenders and doesn‚Äôt make a whole lot of changes over the offseason. That would certainly be ideal for the Dallas Cowboys as the Eagles are, well, um, not good.It is possible given this hypothetical that it makes sense to want the Eagles to win the NFC East so as to lull their franchise into a false sense of security in terms of how good they really are; however, they are the Eagles and seeing them win is nauseating.I‚Äôm aware that you don‚Äôt ever want to see any non-Cowboys team win the division, but it is literally going to happen whether we want it to or not.So all of that being said... who do you hope wins it?

The Cowboys‚Äô gradual sink into infamy has been Titanic-esque, and the iceberg that was Dak Prescott‚Äôs leg injury marked the tipping point that sent Dallas‚Äô ship plunging into hypothermic waters.If you could draw out the team‚Äôs season on a plot point graph, each week would represent a constant downward-trending mark-off in a line that at this point has been decrescent past the point of no return.That is, at least - until their shocking near-win vs. Pittsburgh at AT&T stadium last week.The ‚ÄòBoys currently sit at 2-7 and third place in the ever-lamentable NFC East, and despite still having a chance to claw their way back into contention, things look bleak right now. Even the squad‚Äôs wins were questionably earned, and had it not been for miraculous kismet vs. New York, and the ultimate brain-fart of brain-farts on Atlanta‚Äôs part in a comical onside kick attempt, their win total would be a goose egg.If you've read a midseason recap on Dallas‚Äô escapades up to this point, it‚Äôs likely been rife with lambasts on their porous performance. And I can easily admit that I‚Äôve been a fervent advocate of the same sentiment. They‚Äôve been terrible. But while there‚Äôs much to talk about in terms of pessimism, this year hasn‚Äôt been completely fraught with negatives. There have been some bright spots, and although they‚Äôve been rare as a two-dollar bill, to gloss over them would be an injustice to the good that has taken place.It‚Äôs a semi-occurrent happenstance, but for my own morale‚Äôs sake (and for that of Cowboys Nation as a whole) it‚Äôs worthy of focus.Here are the top three showings from the ‚ÄòBoys thus far.This was probably the most evenly-contested matchup Dallas partook in all season. And ironically, one of the ‚ÄòBoys best outings came with the least amount of preconditioning under their belts.The team who stopped Dallas‚Äô 2018 Super Bowl bid short was first up on their 2020 schedule, and the matchup lived up to its massive Sunday Night billing. There were stars to be recognized on both sides: Prescott, Elliott, Cooper. Donald, Ramsey, Woods.And Mike McCarthy would get a revealing first-game test against play-calling guru Sean McVay. While he didn't quite pass, his initial offering was not foretelling of anything close to the crumple we would witness soon thereafter. His offense accounted for 380 collective yards and 24 first downs, while posting their most efficient 60-minute slate yet, surrendering no turnovers to the opposition.Dak Prescott was serviceably comfortable in the pocket, dispersing accurate passes like free handouts to a variety of his most reliable targets. Dallas surrendered an early 7-0 lead, but regained their footing in the second on a vintage Elliott rumble out of the backfield. Elliott would finish with 96 yards on 22 carries, while raking in three big receptions, including the touchdown.Meanwhile the defense held its own, and although they were a step slow both on-field and strategic-wise, they got momentous contributions from several key components, and forced one of their lone takeaways on the year with a Chidobe Awuzie interception as well.The game remained a back-and-forth slobberknocker until its final minutes, and the ‚ÄòBoys secondary came up with a huge stop on a 3rd-and-3 to return the pigskin to their quarterback with just over two minutes remaining.Then came the controversy.Prescott willed his team forward on a few dump routes, before the dwindling clock beckoned a deep shot from #4. He acquiesced, and found Michael Gallup downfield in a one-on-one matchup with Jalen Ramsey, who jolted past his defender and reeled in a 40+ yard reception.Except there was a flag. Which, thrown with under 20 seconds left rendered their chances for comeback dead and moot. It‚Äôs tough to see games decided by officials, especially when it‚Äôs your team that‚Äôs on the wrong end of a loss. And it was a devastating one when taking all circumstances into account.My unbiased opinion as a Michael Gallup fantasy owner is that this was not an offensive pass interference. pic.twitter.com/LETU7WLBObBut ludicrously enough, it became one of Dallas‚Äô superior performances on the year.This was the outing in which everything collectively hit the fan.The fact that it‚Äôs one of Dallas‚Äô best three performances is a testament to how poorly the troupe has played all year. But it was the poise and harmonious demeanor with which Dallas responded in lieu of Dak Prescott‚Äôs trip-up that vaults this game into the #2 slot.Unlike their usual status quo, the Cowboys actually jumped out to an early lead in the game, and writ their trademark all over its opening moments as the Giants D faltered in containment efforts. The ‚ÄòBoys defense, though, showcased more of the same ineptitude that has plummeted them to a bottom spot in league rankings.Daniel Jones looked like Fran Tarkenton on the pitch, and the Giants QB ducked, dodged and scrambled circles around Dallas‚Äô brigade, easily coasting back downfield for an emphatic touchdown in response.Then the Giants defense woke up out of their slumber.On the following possession, Kyler Fackrell picked off Prescott and found paydirt following an Elliott botched catch attempt, before another stop allowed NY to kick a field goal to increase their lead to 17-3.This marked the emergence of Prescott-time.Prescott willed his team back downfield like a calculative chess master-like returning drive, garnering enough field position for Elliott to smoothly slide into the end zone for his first TD. Dallas would force a turnover on New York‚Äôs ensuing try - a crunching DeMarcus Lawrence sack dislodged Jones of the football, which found Anthony Brown with ready mitts and nothing but daylight in front of him as he raced back towards the Giant lead, knotting the table at 17.Big Blue would retort with a FG of their own, before #4 flashed his armor again - this time piercing the Giants secondary with a surprise TD reception on a throwback from Cedric Wilson.It would be one of the last times he would have the luxury to do so.The G-men added another three-ball as the second half got underway, and Prescott - as he‚Äôs done time and time again - began guiding his squadron towards fort NY. He‚Äôs a fearless captain that has no problem sinking with the ship, and unfortunately, that fervor became his imminent downfall.There is no need to fully detail what happened next. It stings most of Cowboys Nation with as great a force as any injury has in the team‚Äôs storied history, and Dak‚Äôs broken ankle with just over six minutes remaining in the third quarter swiftly dashed hopes of success on the season - let alone a win in the game.Well don‚Äôt tell Andy Dalton that. Dallas scored on that same possession after a Dalton-Lamb connection granted them adequate territory for an Elliott scamper. Elliott flashed a resounding #4 to the camera as he joined his teammates in celebration, and if his team‚Äôs message hadn‚Äôt clear been up to that point, he made sure that it was fully felt: we‚Äôre going to win for Dak.They didn‚Äôt fail their fallen soldier.The D was able to thwart off Jones and company‚Äôs next attempt for salvage, and while they surrendered a late score to Devonta Freeman, they unanimously rose to the game‚Äôs largest occasion - forcing a punt with close to a minute left and a 34-34 tie.Dalton would proceed to create a career-type moment for himself, dropping off three pivotal passes in succession - the last of which found a streaking Michael Gallup on the receiving end just inside the 20-yard line.Greg Zuerlein took care of the rest, depositing a painless game-winner as time expired to seal the victory - one that was unequivocally earned in honor of #4.The total over-under for points this game was more likely to eclipse 43.5 than it was to tunnel the number. And this had nothing to do with Dallas. The undefeated Pittsburgh Steelers were projected to completely blow the Cowboys out of the water last Sunday.Dallas had been reduced to their fourth QB of the season, while Big Ben has been Pro Bowl-worthy in his return from the injury shelf. And don‚Äôt even get me started on Pittsburgh‚Äôs bullish defense. Every viable piece of evidence one could use pitted the Cowboys in a dangerous line of fire as the ‚ÄòBurgh eagerly awaited kill-shot allowance upon arrival at AT&T stadium.They‚Äôve been most experts‚Äô #1 seeded defense since the season‚Äôs inception, coexisting as a consolidated wrecking crew led by the likes of T.J. Watt, Bud Dupree and Minkah Fitzpatrick. But little did we know - Dallas‚Äô barricade had a few tricks up their own sleeve.They diffused Ben Roethlisberger and the ‚ÄòBurgh offense to near Sahara-like dryness as the matchup got underway, while rendering the Steelers quadruplet behemoth of Juju Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool, Diontae Johnson and James Washington nearly impotent.Meanwhile, next man up Garrett Gilbert looked smooth and effortless in the pocket. He was confident from the opening snap, and fired off a beautiful pass on his initial attempt - a rainbow floater for Amari Cooper, who sped his way past midfield. They would have to settle for a field goal though after Pittsburgh bounced back to quell their momentum.Dallas snatched it right back after a huge fourth-down stop on a risky Steelers‚Äô gamble, and Gilbert broke off two first-down rushes before following up a dime throw to Dalton Schultz with an even better one to CeeDee Lamb for six.Pittsburgh found themselves unable to gain traction again, and things went from bad to worse for the black and yellow on a sly trick call from John Fassel on the ensuing punt. The play: a cunning throwback design that misguided the defense to one side of the field, while a (supposedly) hobbled C.J. Goodwin masqueraded down the other - an intriguingly perfect deceit. The big breakdown allowed Goodwin to scoot to the 10-yard line, but the ‚ÄòBoys found themselves unable to capitalize, settling for another FG.Pittsburgh began to transform into their old selves near the end of the second half as Big Ben added another touchdown pass to his tremendous total. As did Dallas - CeeDee Lamb fumbled near his own end zone to allow the Steelers an extra three. Still, though, Dallas reached halftime with a lead - a sentiment that prior to the game would‚Äôve incited hysterical laughter.The ‚ÄòBoys added two more Greg Zuerlein kicks to increase their advantage to 10, while the defense continued their surprise dominance by holding Pittsburgh scoreless in the third quarter.But what‚Äôs this 2020 season without a Cowboys fold? The two are one and the same, and the floodgates opened in the fourth.Pittsburgh got a timely touchdown from James Washington, and Garrett Gilbert followed that with an interception of his own. The Steelers got a FG from the blunder, as well as the ball with just over three minutes left - which was a welcome treat for the seasoned Roethlisberger. He spearheaded his team to another game-winning drive, effectively keeping their spotless record intact along the way.Still, though, Dallas was a worthy contender. They put up a 364 yard total - their highest since Prescott went down, and relinquished their lowest rushing number on the campaign in addition (64).And they almost won. It will be counted as a loss nonetheless, but in a season with this much turmoil, it can‚Äôt possibly be deemed a horrid one. There were several flashes of competence, and even dominance. Flashes that, while short-lived, will still be preserved as long as possible while we eagerly await a change in tide."

We all know Harvey to be the unofficial NFL Champion for QB sacks in a single season. Michael Strahan is credited with the record with 22 1/2 sacks during the 2002 season. Strahan benefited from a 16 game schedule, as well as a gift sack of Brett Favre in the final minutes of the final game of that season.During the Cowboys championship season of 1977 Harvey had 23 QB sacks, This was accomplished during a 14 game NFL schedule. The Cowboys have film of every single sack Harvey made that year. Harvey was Co MVP of Super Bowl 12 along with Randy White. Harvey had a total of 114 career sacks, was a 4 time Pro Bowler, and is a member of the 1970's NFL All Decade Team. The problem is the NFL does not recognize QB sacks before 1982. Harvey's 114 sacks are more than 3 current HOF players.As a long time NFL and Cowboy fan I can say that Harvey Martin in his prime was one of the most dominate DE to play the game. His ""Too Beautiful Harvey Martin"" radio show was not bad either.Rest in Peace Harvey. Gone far too soon.Another user-created commentary provided by a BTB reader."

(For better or worse.) I have my own opinions about what the team should do moving forward if/when they end up with a top 3 pick, but I wonder what they will actually do. Recently, both Jerry and Stephen have said categorically that Dak is their guy and that he's gonna lead this team for the foreseeable future. I think that there's some truth to this myself, but not necessarily if they get the #1 pick. But, to be real, what else are they going to say at this time?I think it's very unlikely that we end up with pick #1 and much more likely that we're somewhere around #5. I'm nearly certain that, if the Cowboys get the 5th pick in the draft they will take BPA for the defense or trade back and stockpile picks if there's the option. And, I'm varying degrees of certain that they will do the same with picks 2-4. It's just that #1 pick that I wonder about.I believe that some team would give a bigger haul of picks than the Rams received from Washington for the rights to RG3. That's extremely tempting to me and just knowing that we already have a top 10 or higher QB already makes me believe that type of haul could push this team over the top for the next 5-10 years. I go with trading the pick and stockpiling.What would y'all do? Not only if we get #1, but also if we get pick 2-4.VOTE view resultsAnother user-created commentary provided by a BTB reader."

However, Dallas did deal a seventh-round pick for Eli Ankou, a big, 325-pound nose tackle from the Texans. After going undrafted out of UCLA in 2017, Ankou spent time between the practice squad and roster with the Texans from 2017 to 2019, and had very brief stints with both the Colts and Texans this year before Dallas scooped him up.Ankou had exactly 398 defensive snaps to his name throughout his brief career, and none of them were in the 2020 season; he did very little in those snaps as well, recording just 26 total tackles, two for loss, and 1.5 sacks. But Dallas saw enough in those snaps to justify giving up a draft pick for him. With his size, Ankou seems like an obvious candidate for the role Dontari Poe was supposed to fill, and Mike Nolan hinted at as much when the transaction was made:Cowboys DC Mike Nolan said newly acquired NT Eli Ankou is a ‚Äúbig, strong man that I think is going to give us some depth on the inside. And I‚Äôm hopeful that he‚Äôs able to contribute sooner than later.‚ÄùAfter clearing the COVID-19 protocols, Ankou was able to make his debut with the Cowboys against the Steelers and show what he‚Äôs got. Ankou only played 11 snaps in the game, which was likely due to a mix of it being his first game with the team and the strong performance of Neville Gallimore in that game. But Ankou, who played exclusively on early downs (8/11 snaps were first-down plays), showed some juice that should lead to more snaps going forward.On this play, Pittsburgh‚Äôs offense had just gotten the ball back from a Dallas punt early in the second quarter. On first and ten, Ankou (#95) is lined up in a 3-technique against the right guard with Aldon Smith in a two-point stance next to him.On the snap, Ankou crashes to his right and the guard moves laterally to pick him up. Once Ankou makes contact with the guard, he does a good job of converting speed to power and backs the guard right up.Ben Roethlisberger ends up getting the ball out quick, and loose coverage from Anthony Brown gives up an easy 14-yard pickup to Chase Claypool. But if Roethlisberger held that ball for a second longer, Ankou would‚Äôve backed the guard right into the quarterback and, at the very least, disrupted the throwing motion. This was a good pass rush rep for Ankou.But Ankou isn‚Äôt a pass rushing tackle, by any stretch. He‚Äôll give you good reps there, but he‚Äôll also put up reps like this next play, which happened two plays after the one above.Prior to the snap, it looks nearly identical to the play diagrammed above. Ankou is the 3-technique with Smith outside in a two-point stance, and Justin Hamilton is the 1-technique. The linebackers are set up differently, but the line is very much showing the same look.Once again, Ankou crashes to his right, but it looks like Hamilton is stunting across the line of scrimmage towards the right tackle. The issue is that Ankou and Hamilton don‚Äôt seem to be on the same page, and they end up getting congested right in the middle of the line of scrimmage.As Hamilton cuts across laterally, he ends up clipping Ankou‚Äôs legs a bit and the big tackle is dropped to the ground. It‚Äôs not entirely clear if this is more on Ankou or Hamilton, but this is definitely not a good pass rush rep. Perhaps more playing time will get Ankou comfortable enough with Hamilton and others to avoid these kinds of collisions, but with this being his first game you‚Äôll see that happen occasionally.Here‚Äôs another rep where Ankou showed some of his potential as a pass rusher. The Cowboys clearly want to use Ankou as more of a run defender, hence his lack of snaps on third downs in this game, but Pittsburgh‚Äôs high frequency of pass plays on first down meant a lot of pass rushing opportunities for Ankou. In fact, all 11 of his snaps came on pass plays, though that‚Äôs hardly what Dallas wanted to use him for.On this series, with the Steelers running a two-minute drill at the end of the first half, the Cowboys used Ankou and Antwaun Woods as their two defensive tackles on this first and ten close to their own 20-yard line. Up until this series, Ankou had only been deployed with Hamilton. As before, though, Ankou is the 3-technique and playing next to Smith.He once again crashes towards the middle of the line, but this time the right tackle and right guard are both preoccupied with Smith, leaving Ankou a one-on-one matchup with eight-time Pro Bowler Maurkice Pouncey. That makes what happens next all the more impressive.Ankou delivers a powerful strike to Pouncey that knocks him a couple feet backwards, as you can see here. Both Smith and Randy Gregory are getting double-teamed as Woods stunts towards the opposite end, but Ankou‚Äôs effective punch gets Pouncey off balance. Given how good Pouncey is, this is considered a big win. We‚Äôll never know what Ankou would‚Äôve done to build on this advantage he created, as Roethlisberger got the ball out immediately after this screenshot. But it showed how Ankou can utilize his size and strength effectively against blockers, both against the run (theoretically at least) and pass.One other thing that stood out while watching him play in his few moments on the field was his motor. Each and every time that Roethlisberger threw the ball, Ankou immediately turned his head and started running to the ball. It was never a big deal considering that other defenders were much closer and made the tackle well before Ankou could arrive, but the coaches will definitely notice Ankou‚Äôs relentless drive towards the football.That‚Äôs about as much as we were able to extract from his limited sample size, but all indications are that Ankou should be in line for even more snaps when the Cowboys travel to Minnesota this week. Given that the Vikings, led by Dalvin Cook, currently have the second-highest run rate and third-highest success rate on run plays in the NFL, getting Ankou on the field to help the run defense will be big.For now, the word on Ankou is very little, but promising. Nolan was absolutely right in describing him as big and strong, and he showed that against the Steelers. He‚Äôs certainly an improvement over what Poe had been providing, and if Ankou can build on this showing then the Cowboys may get some return on that seventh-round pick."

That was the year they said goodbye to players like Brandon Carr, Morris Claiborne, Barry Church and J.J. Wilcox. They headed into the draft and spent a second-round pick on Chidobe Awuzie, a third-round pick on Jourdan Lewis, and a sixth-round pick on Xavier Woods. Boom, instant makeover.Now, they might have to do it again. All three of those players taken in the 2017 draft - Awuzie, Lewis and Woods - are scheduled to be unrestricted free agents this upcoming offseason. The Cowboys have already made some strides in bringing in young talent; Trevon Diggs looks like a keeper at corner, and Donovan Wilson is seeing some time at safety and doesn‚Äôt look too out of place.They also picked up Reggie Robinson in the draft, but so far he has yet to see the field. Here was Jerry Jones‚Äô take on him from a few days ago.Why doesn‚Äôt Reggie Robinson play? With Trevon Diggs injured, will he see time at cornerback or is he strictly a safetyJones: ‚ÄúThe facts are that that needs to stay a question, just like you‚Äôre talking about. Young guy needs to be able to focus more. He needs less position flex activity, a younger guy. On the other hand, he has the ability to help us across the secondary. But your point is, sure, that‚Äôs what the loss of Diggs, the spot, the number coming available. That‚Äôs what it does to you, and you play those guys, and then those guys are all of a sudden just better for having played the game. I know you ‚Äî why it doesn‚Äôt happen is because usually you think the situation is just not worthy of the mistakes that a young makes, And, so, you go to the experience side. It‚Äôs overall in the best interest of the team to play the inexperience overall. But you want the inexperience to not screw it up.‚ÄùThat‚Äôs a word salad extraordinaire even for Jerry Jones. But what he seems to be saying is that Robinson just isn‚Äôt ready yet. Basically it sounds like he needs a red-shirt year.Jones was also asked about Awuzie and Lewis.What you looking for out of Chidobe Awuzie and Jourdan Lewis for the rest of the year?Jones: ‚ÄúThose are real ‚Äî those are very pointed areas that we must look at. We must look at our style of play. We have to look at availability. We have to ‚Äî we have changed to some degree what we expect a D-back to give us out there. All of that has really shows up and has shown up. This is when we take advantage of it. It goes right to a Robinson question or these guys that have more experience. Now, let me just say this. Both those guys you just mentioned, I can you tell you right now, if they‚Äôre healthy and available they need to be out there. They can help us make the plays we want to make down the stretch here.‚ÄùIt‚Äôs interesting that Jones said we must look at the style of play. He seems to be saying there is a real debate about whether those two corners fit what the Cowboys hope to be doing going forward in their new defensive scheme.Which brings us back to 2021 free agency. Are Awuzie, Lewis or Woods even worth putting up free agent money for? Obviously if they want to sign a cheap deal that is one thing, but should the Cowboys make a real play for them or wait to see if they are around in the second/third waves of free agency."

Losing Gerald McCoy before the season began really hurt the interior of this line, then later losing productive young defensive tackle Trysten Hill dealt another blow to the struggling line.The Cowboys would also sustain injuries at linebacker and cornerback that really hurt them as well with Leighton Vander Each, Sean Lee, Anthony Brown, and Chidobe Awuzie all going down with injuries and missing multiple games. The defense still had to go out and try to make plays but were unable to get the job done on the field. Some of that had to with the scheme from defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and his ability this offseason to get it fully implemented.The hybrid 4-3/3-4 defense has been a struggle for players to grasp early in the season as players weren't reacting on the field and instead were thinking too much about their responsibilities. Those issues allowed opposing offenses to run up the score early on the Cowboys. The good thing for this defense now, though, is that the players seem to have settled into their roles and responsibilities, and it's starting to show on the field.They aren't making as many mistakes as they did earlier. Let‚Äôs hope that they can continue to get better.Let‚Äôs see what you all think about the defense going forward."
674,cowboys,https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2020/11/17/21572346/report-cowboys-sign-defensive-lineman-breeland-speaks-to-practice-squad,Report: Cowboys sign defensive lineman Breeland Speaks to practice squad,"FILED UNDER:A new defensive lineman for the Cowboys roster.The Dallas Cowboys were off last week, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that they weren‚Äôt busy working. As Stephen Jones likes to say, roster construction is a 24/7/365 business in the NFL.With the team getting ready to take on the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday they are looking to get back some players that have been out due to injury. Guys like Chidobe Awuzie immediately jump to mind, but unfortunately there are a lot of players who won‚Äôt return this year as they have been lost for the season.Dallas lost a few defensive lineman for the season (Gerald McCoy, Trysten Hill) and is currently dealing with defensive end Tyrone Crawford being on the Reserve/COVID-19 list. They have seen some solid returns on guys like Randy Gregory and Aldon Smith this season, so a few of their investments are paying off.As noted, there are spots on the defensive line these days, especially in the aftermath of the Everson Griffen trade and with the season looking a bit lost, where it doesn‚Äôt hurt to see a rotation of guys and experiment a little. We have known the Cowboys to kick the tires on players that were once viewed as prominent but were out of the game (see Aldon Smith as an example) and it appears that they are doing that again as they have reportedly signed Breeland Speaks to their practice squad.Cowboys signed DL Breeland Speaks to their practice squad. Speaks, the Chiefs‚Äô second-round draft pick in 2018, missed last year with a knee injury. He worked out for Dallas during its bye week.Speaks was a second-round pick in 2018 and was taken just four selections before the Cowboys nabbed Connor Williams. He was heralded by the Kansas City Chiefs at the time, but things just ultimately never worked out for him as he suffered an injury during the preseason last year.Chiefs general manager Brett Veach is regarded as one of the best in the NFL so seeing him dismiss Speaks was a bit shocking. He attributed it to Kansas City being deep at the position if you are wondering why they ultimately said goodbye.Almost two and a half years later, Veach cut his inaugural draft pick, along with 24 other players ‚Äî five days before the season opener. When asked about it during his Sunday press conference, Veach cited the level of competition Speaks faced.‚ÄúOf all the positions, that defensive line position is probably our deepest position,‚Äù Veach acknowledged. ‚ÄúWith Breeland [Speaks], it was a different scheme when he got here, and our staff really thought his rookie year he did some things you can lay a foundation on. We all know he came in a little out of shape the next year, and then he had the injury. When you get behind the eight-ball in professional football, it‚Äôs tough. When you get behind the eight-ball on a roster with a deep defensive line, it‚Äôs even tougher.‚ÄùSpeaks is reportedly joining the Cowboys practice squad and not the actual roster so it‚Äôs unknown when, or if, he will see legitimate time with the team. If he does hopefully he is able to show something for the future."

For Dallas, that includes Andy Dalton, who was the starting quarterback replacing Dak Prescott. When he in turn went down, the team quickly found out that Ben DiNucci was not quite ready for prime time. That forced them to start their fourth different QB in Week 9 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, journeyman backup and former AAF star Garrett Gilbert. It had all the hallmarks of a looming disaster.But surprisingly, it wasn‚Äôt. Gilbert may not have been great, given that he only managed to lead the team to one touchdown and they settled for field goals on both trips into the red zone. Still, he had Dallas in the game all the way - and they actually led most of regulation for the first time all season. It was the best performance at quarterback the Cowboys have seen since Prescott was lost.Yet despite that, the top brass insist that Dalton will return to the starting job, despite a couple of rough outings in his first two starts. It is a topic for debate for many - and that includes our David Howman and Tom Ryle.Tom: Look, I‚Äôm just a guy blogging from my late mom‚Äôs nonexistent basement, but from watching the games Dalton started and then what Gilbert did against the Pittsburgh Steelers defense, I am a lot more excited by the latter than the former. I always had the impression that Dalton was most likely just a one-year rental who would look around for a new starting gig next season, so I really don‚Äôt know why the team seems so invested in him.David: I‚Äôm fully on board with the idea of Andy Dalton being the starter when he‚Äôs ready to go, and not just because I like being a contrarian. I was a big fan of the AAF (still heartbroken about how it ended) so it was fun to see Garrett Gilbert get his shot, and he did look good. But he also benefitted from a more cohesive offensive line than Dalton had, which I think blurs the lines in this evaluation.Bottom line is this: the Cowboys are tanking, but the nuance of tanking means you can never admit that, and especially not to the players. Otherwise you risk losing the locker room, and Mike McCarthy just got past the early mutiny by some unnamed players. The creative game plans against Philadelphia and Pittsburgh seem to have gotten the players to buy into McCarthy‚Äôs win-at-all-costs mindset, and that‚Äôs going to be big in the long run. Going with Gilbert at quarterback when you have a nine-year veteran with 70 career wins to his name sends the message that you don‚Äôt actually care about winning this year.While that‚Äôs true for this year‚Äôs Cowboys team, you just don‚Äôt say the quiet part out loud. Take last year‚Äôs Dolphins, for example. They were obviously tanking, but first-year head coach Brian Flores chose to play veteran Ryan Fitzpatrick over second-year pro Josh Rosen because he believed Fitzpatrick gave them a better chance to win. As a result, the Dolphins were able to finish 5-4, get all their players bought in to the culture, and still got the guy they were tanking for (who, by the way, looks pretty good through two games). The Cowboys need Andy Dalton to play for the culture.Tom: I know it‚Äôs a different regime and all, but I‚Äôm still a fan of the hot hand. Gilbert came very close to leading the team to a win against the best team the Cowboys will face all year. I‚Äôm not so sure starting him over Dalton would in any way signal a lack of trying to win. To me, it would be wanting to see if Gilbert can step up with a full game under his belt and even improve on what was a good but certainly imperfect effort.There is also the element, based on an admittedly small sample size, that Gilbert looks to have a game that is much more like Dak Prescott‚Äôs than Dalton. With a team that was built to play to Prescott‚Äôs skill set, it just seem to me that putting in a quarterback that emulates that more would be the way to go. Gilbert certainly showed some budding chemistry with all the receivers. He had some bad throws, but his good ones certainly worked. It may be a difference in perspective, but I think Gilbert is the more aggressive approach to trying to get some wins. To me, Dalton is more a choice to just play out the string without risking a high draft pick. Which may actually be the objective.David: I want to clarify that I like what I saw from Gilbert, and if I‚Äôm in charge I‚Äôm keeping him over DiNucci going forward as my developmental quarterback. But in the short term, I think Dalton is the answer at starting quarterback. If I were a bigger nerd, I‚Äôd explain why the hot hand theory is actually a fallacy and that Gilbert is almost certainly due for a hard regression sooner rather than later, but math is hard.Instead, I‚Äôll point out that Gilbert had a favorable matchup. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be, as the Steelers defense has been dominant all year long. However, Pittsburgh decided to change up their strategy and rarely blitzed against Gilbert, thinking that flooding the field with coverage players would easily bait Gilbert into bad throws; it was also likely a bet that their elite pass rushers could win against this offensive line without having to send extra rushers.That wasn‚Äôt the case. Pittsburgh, who leads the NFL in sacks, only got to Gilbert twice on Sunday for a meager 5% sack rate. By comparison, Dalton has had a sack rate of 7.6% in his brief time playing for the Cowboys; that‚Äôs the second-highest in his career, and only seven quarterbacks this year have a higher sack rate. Of those seven, the only one with a winning record is Lamar Jackson, who plays for the loaded Ravens. In short, Dalton‚Äôs offensive line - which featured Connor McGovern playing in place of Zack Martin for the majority of his two starts - was bad, and facing two teams that got a whole lot of pressure. I‚Äôd like to see what Dalton can do with coherent pass protection, especially since their next game (the Vikings) features a team near the bottom in both pass rush win rate and sacks.Tom: But, as has been objectively proven, sacks are a QB stat.OK, so that‚Äôs more a hotly contested opinion, but I find some validity in the idea. The Steelers game showed Gilbert moving around a lot and doing so to good effect. With the still suspect offensive line, even though we hope to see Brandon Knight back soon, I still contend Gilbert is a better choice. Certainly there is a danger of regression, but that is something that would be valuable to evaluate. Gilbert could have a role for this team going forward.That may be the biggest reason I would like to see him get another start. The Cowboys need to be looking to the future. Not only would more playing time let them do that with him, the more snaps he takes, the more he can learn and grow. This is a time they can invest in him, and still be fighting for wins. And if Gilbert falters badly, then they could roll Dalton back out.It‚Äôs not up to either of us, of course, and all indications are that you will get your preference. In either case, I hope that we will see Gilbert on the roster next season."

Every year we see so much turnover as far as players, coaches, scouts, and a number of other roles, and whenever someone gets an opportunity to see their former employer, you occasionally hear about a ‚Äúrevenge game‚Äù-type performance.Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy hasn‚Äôt outright committed to a starting quarterback for Sunday‚Äôs game against the Minnesota Vikings, but Jerry Jones and Stephen Jones both have to a degree, and it seems as if Andy Dalton will be under center after returning from a concussion and time on the Reserve/COVID-19 list.Dalton‚Äôs more obvious ‚Äúrevenge game‚Äù opportunity will be in a couple of weeks when the Cowboys visit the Cincinnati Bengals (a week after Dez Bryant might have one of his own when the Baltimore Ravens host Dallas), but there is an inkling of that narrative for this game should Dalton be the starting quarterback, and it involves the other head coach in the game.The Cowboys will face a former assistant coach of their own on Sunday, as if this game was lacking revenge-type angles, when Mike Zimmer leads his Vikings against them, but they‚Äôve already squared off against him as a head coach. Been there and done that.Where this game is a bit interesting is in the quarterback leading Zimmer‚Äôs old team, and it‚Äôs one who led one of his old teams as well. If you‚Äôre lost by that statement remember that Zimmer and Andy Dalton spent three years going against one another in practice with the Cincinnati Bengals when Dalton was the quarterback and Zimmer the defensive coordinator. That‚Äôs a lot of daily battles, and they were apparently quite tough for Dalton. From our friends at Cincy Jungle back in May of 2012:One of the perks of having a talented team coupled with a talented coaching staff is being able to go against some of the league‚Äôs best day in and day out. In the last two weeks‚Äô OTA sessions, Dalton is getting all that he can handle from defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer and his defensive unit. According to Paul Dehner, Jr. of CBSSports, Zimmer threw everything but the kitchen sink at Dalton in practices, which usually is a stark contrast to what teams attempt to do in these early OTA sessions.The neat thing about Zimmer employing this coaching technique is that it not only gives him an idea as to which defensive players are up to the challenge of digesting complicated schemes, but it also gives the offense some experience against multiple formations. In a division that pits the Bengals against two defensive juggernauts in Baltimore and Pittsburgh, this is a great learning experience for the second-year quarterback. The Browns defense may not be as complex at the Ravens‚Äô or Steelers‚Äô, but they are nothing to scoff at either, as they finished 2011 with a top-ten overall ranking.It is worth mentioning that these were the OTAs following Dalton‚Äôs rookie season in the NFL, so baptizing him further into the league is obviously something that the Cincinnati staff wanted to do. Not to put too much stock into this idea as a whole, but there are likely few defensive coordinators or defensive head coaches in the league today that know Dalton‚Äôs capabilities better than Zimmer does.Not to focus too much on an incredibly small sample size, but all of this played very poorly for Dalton in his lone matchup against Zimmer as the Minnesota Vikings head coach. The Bengals visited Minnesota in December of 2017 and things did not go great at all for the current Cowboys quarterback. He finished 11 of 22 for 133 passing yards with two interceptions and was actually pulled in favor of his backup A.J. McCarron due to how much of a blowout it was.One game three years ago hardly means that Mike Zimmer will always get the better of Andy Dalton, but the Vikings currently have the 10th-best defensive by DVOA so the waters are likely going to be a bit rough for Dalton.Perhaps Dalton will even the score with Mike Zimmer on Sunday afternoon or maybe the Cowboys will lose their fifth game in a row. This season has been one of great unknown and mystery and with Mike McCarthy‚Äôs teams being 9-4 in games out of the bye something has got to give in one direction."

Losing can bring with it an obvious negative energy and that has definitely been the case at times for the 2020 version of America‚Äôs Team. This is a unique season in many ways, but the Cowboys have been beaten up and injured from the very jump. In just about every way this season feels like it never got a chance to get off of the ground.When the team returns from their off week there will be seven games left, and while there is still technically a legitimate path to them to get into the playoffs by way of the subpar NFC East, it seems like this team‚Äôs best odds are for 2021 and beyond.Considering this to be the case, the remainder of this year is about one thing for the Cowboys (besides ensuring the highest possible draft pick... here‚Äôs what they need in Week 10 in order for that to happen) and that is data collection.Some questions are answered about the future already, but some still hover. Here are three that we will be looking to answer over the coming months.Blake Jarwin was lost for the season during the opening game back against the Los Angeles Rams which immediately put a question mark around the tight end spot. Dallas paid Jarwin over the offseason and finally said a firm goodbye to Jason Witten, so to see the heir apparent not even get a legitimate shot was a bit of a bummer.Dalton Schultz was drafted by the team in the immediate days after Witten‚Äôs retirement in 2018. National pundits speculated that the team was addressing the future of the position by acquiring him but bright minds knew better and that Jarwin had a better chance of succeeding long-term.This idea may not have changed, but Dalton Schultz has absolutely looked like a starting-caliber tight end in the NFL. When everything is back to normal from an injury standpoint, this team figures to operate mostly out of 11 personnel which only leaves room for one tight end. Who would you want that to be at present time?Dalton Schultz is putting up a few top-10 numbers this season:

-Receiving Yards: 383 (ranks 5th among TEs)
-Total YAC: 175 (ranks 6th)
-1st Downs: 19 (ranks t-7th)#Cowboys pic.twitter.com/eifXtNMa8UAgain, this isn‚Äôt trying to give away Jarwin‚Äôs job after he didn‚Äôt exactly get a chance to defend it, but Schultz has been one of the few bright spots on offense as a whole this year. Ultimately this situation will likely boil down to the Cowboys having a bit of a full cupboard up top at tight end in 2021, but it is worth mentioning that next season is the last of Schultz‚Äôs rookie contract.Dallas might not have to make a decision on Schultz‚Äôs long-term future with the team in the offseason, but this season is giving them a lot of information to use when that time finally presents itself.There have certainly been times where each of us has been frustrated with the team‚Äôs new head coach in Mike McCarthy, but it is certainly not difficult to arrive to the conclusion that he has hardly had a fair shake during his first year at the helm of the most visible team in professional sports.When McCarthy signed up to be this team‚Äôs head coach, Travis Frederick was still his starting center. Fast forward a whole hodgepodge of chaos and the unit he meets every day is a shell of the one that served as the center of many offseason pieces predicting them to be Super Bowl contenders.Assuming you are in agreement here, we all understand that this year is a bit of a mulligan for Mike McCarthy, but to the point at hand it obviously still counts. The Cowboys made the mistake of hitching themselves to Jason Garrett year after year because they couldn‚Äôt properly assess what millions of their fans could, the least they can do with McCarthy‚Äôs situation is evaluate how much room for error they truly want to give him.Results aside, McCarthy now has had one draft class to work with and one free agency group to acquire. His teachings and philosophies can still show up regardless of what the team‚Äôs record is and so it is certainly possible to grade his first year with the team.The brain-trust of the Cowboys has to figure out now, when they are not emotionally compromised, what the requirement needs to be of McCarthy and what the timeframe is on it. Will the group revisit things in a year, after his first draft class‚Äô rookie contracts end, if the team finishes below .500 again, or what?That question needs to be answered and more importantly needs to be utilized over the coming seasons.As noted there are a number of familiar faces absent from starting lineups, but before all of that happened there were several members of the team that have been around when it was debatable whether or not they should be.It feels like the book is out on guys like Jaylon Smith, but that is a different type of decision. 2021 might finally be the time for the Cowboys to say farewell to players like Tyrone Crawford and Chris Jones as they have held on for far too long there and ignored improving for the sake of either complacency or downright refusal.We have seen the Cowboys devote snaps to younger players in recent weeks and that has shown strong results so far in someone like Neville Gallimore. It obviously isn‚Äôt easy to wave the white flag and say that you are treating an entire half of a season like an exhibition period, but the situation is what the situation is.The time for procrastination has come and gone. As disappointing as this season is, it now provides the organization with an opportunity to ask themselves some hard questions and take the proper time to answer them. The future literally depends on the Cowboys looking under all of these rocks, and the flaws that existed within the team back in 2017 showed an example of how they didn‚Äôt take proper advantage of the last opportunity that they had like this in 2015.It is time for data collection."

Unfortunately, their inability to secure the football gave opposing teams the ability to score early and often. Their own ability to score has now been seriously hampered with the season ending injuries to Prescott, Smith, and Collins.The Cowboys offensive coordinator, Kellen Moore, has had to get creative in his play-calling to help the three quarterbacks that have come in after Prescott at quarterback. All have differing skill sets and experience levels in the NFL, and that is a tall task for this second-year coordinator. Moore has done the best he can with what he has but the loss of those three players for the season has really crippled this offense.That‚Äôs not to say that we should count out this offense. Last week they showed signs of life with quarterback Garrett Gilbert under center. Having Zack Martin healthy was a big deal, too. They were able to push the ball down the field and score a touchdown, something that had not been done in the two previous games. Gilbert gave this team a spark and could be just what the Cowboys needs for the rest of the season if they really believe they have a shot at winning the NFC East."

The highs, well, have been high, and the lows have been rather low. But one things for certain with Diggs, he‚Äôs going to be a solid player in the NFL. That‚Äôs what makes his possible season-ending foot injury that much harder to swallow for the Dallas Cowboys.This is where the 2021 NFL Draft could have a massive impact on the Cowboy defensive success for the foreseeable future. Along with the stalled development of Diggs, starting cornerback Chidobe Awuzie is slated to hit free agency at the end of the year, and has been injured for almost the entire year. Jourdan Lewis, the Cowboys starting nickel-corner is also in-line to hit the open market this coming offseason as well. That leaves a big-time hole at the cornerback position for the Cowboys, and sets it up for Trevon Diggs to be the teams best cornerback again in 2021.Unless...Welcome to the 2021 NFL Draft.As it stands today, the Cowboys are slated to pick in the third slot of the draft, surrounded by a bunch of premium quarterback prospects, a stud offensive lineman, and then a sudden, but minimal drop-off. The need at cornerback, and the possibility of trading back while picking up more picks, and still landing the player you‚Äôre likely to take at your original draft-slot is chef‚Äôs kiss. It‚Äôs still extremely early, but there‚Äôs a few names I think we should touch on as possible top sevenish draft picks, as well as potential trade-back candidates that could step in and make an impact on day one.Possessing the ideal size, length, and physical traits, Surtain II is the total package at corner for the Dallas Cowboys. Surtain II is an ideal press-man corner with the smarts to play multiple coverages in the secondary for Mike Nolan/whoever is running the defense in 2021. While some may question the elite-athletic traits of Surtain II, I see little worry with Surtain‚Äôs long-speed, burst, and change of direction skills as a boundary corner. Pairing Surtain II and Diggs in the secondary would give the Cowboys two Crimson Tide corners with excellent ball skills, and sky-high ceilings as press-man corners on the outside.Patrick Surtain II #RollTide #MSSTvsBAMA pic.twitter.com/sr7zFXqvVuIt‚Äôs going to be extremely difficult separating Farley and Surtain II throughout the pre-draft process, which is great news for the Cowboys. Similar to Surtain II, Farley possesses ideal length, athleticism, and coverage skills to find early success, with a sky-high ceiling due to his physical and athletic traits. The upside with Farley is that he‚Äôs been extremely successful, but he‚Äôs still relatively new to the position with only a handful of games played as a corner (injuries & COVID-19 opt-out) There are some injury concerns to be hashed out with Farley, but it‚Äôll be hard to to not fall in love with his tape and potential with Farley and Diggs remaking the Dallas secondary.Virginia Tech CB Caleb Farley(3) has the physical tools to be the next dominant shutdown corner. His ability to click and close is similar to 2020 CB1 Jeff Okudah‚Äôs. pic.twitter.com/Y7HHgcZLi6Let it be known, I absolutely love Jaycee Horn. It‚Äôll be hard to find a player that plays as physical and with as much effort as Horn at South Carolina. Another prime-candidate to find early success as a press-man corner due to his physicality at the line of scrimmage, but it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt stop there for Horn. He battles his tail off throughout the route-stem, and at the catch point. For the group of Cowboy fans who want to see more ‚Äúdogs‚Äù on this defense, you‚Äôll love what you see from Jaycee Horn on tape as his on-field mentality screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an alpha‚Äù.@jayceehorn_10 is the best cornerback in college football. I‚Äôm not here to argue, I‚Äôm here to state facts!!! #SFSP 1% pic.twitter.com/sVIEyX9LTUIf you‚Äôre a big college football fan, or an Ohio State Buckeyes fan, you‚Äôll know that Wade has had his struggles this year testing the waters of boundary cornerback, after primarily playing in the slot for Ohio State in previous years. While Wade has had his struggles on the outside this year, he‚Äôs also had his moments of looking natural on the outside, which makes his value higher due to the position versatility of playing both inside and out. Wade has excellent size for either the slot or the outside, and pairs his size with excellent athleticism to mirror receivers off the ball and stay in tight coverage throughout the stem. Wade could be an intriguing trade-back candidate for the Cowboys, given they‚Äôll have a need at nickel with Jourdan Lewis likely leaving, and Anthony Brown primarily lining up on the outside.C3 teach tape here by CB Shaun Wade. Look at drop at an angle to stay on top of the post, fall off, and cut off the corner route.

Chefs kiss* pic.twitter.com/wWk0GB76pMThe good thing about this upcoming cornerback class is the Cowboys should have plenty of options in round one if they want to go that direction. The top two guys could be taken in the top ten and not a soul would bat an eye, but it‚Äôs nice to have trade-back options, and that‚Äôs where Jaycee Horn and Shaun Wade come into play. At the end of the day the Cowboys need to build their secondary to be their strength as that‚Äôll make everything easier for the defense moving forward."

Mercifully, we‚Äôre a little over halfway through the 2020 regular season. For the Dallas Cowboys, it‚Äôs been as disappointing a first half as anyone could have imagined.Dallas came into the 2020 season with the sixth highest Super Bowl odds of any team in football, according to FanDuel. They also were the clear favorite in the NFC East. Now, just over two months into the season, how things have changed. FanDuel now has the Cowboys with the eighth worst Super Bowl odds, a +21000 underdog.Granted, there are plenty of reasons for the disappointing year to date. The Cowboys have been hit as hard as any team by the injury bug. They‚Äôve lost Dak Prescott, Gerald McCoy, Tyron Smith, and La‚Äôel Collins, all for the season. Dallas also has suffered plenty of other key injuries on both sides of the ball. The Cowboys also, for the first time in 10 years, brought in an entire new coaching staff that had to deal with the strangest offseason in years because of COVID.It‚Äôs a tough time for the Cowboys, and things may only get worse. The light at the end of the tunnel is a potential top-five pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, and the hope that their stars will recover and come back healthy next season.Despite the Cowboys shot at making the postseason being down the drain, there is still plenty to look back on through the first nine games of 2020. Today, we‚Äôll kick off our midseason review series, by having our front page writers answer the question, ‚Äúwho/what surprised you most in the first half?‚ÄùNow onto the BTB Writers biggest first half surprise....What most surprised me was the way the free agents that we talked ourselves into being so excited about turned into diddly and squat. Outside of Greg Zuerlein, there was almost nothing there. Everson Griffen was at times serviceable, but apparently not enough to keep around. Ha Ha Clinton-Dix couldn‚Äôt even make the roster out of camp. Brandon Carr couldn‚Äôt see eye to eye with the staff. Dontari Poe was just washed, and Gerald McCoy was lost to the first of the interminable injuries. While the names were better known, it was another trip to the remainders bin for the Cowboys, with results we should have seen coming. So being surprised was all on me, I guess.The thing that surprised me most was how badly the Cowboys struck out on their three defensive free agents. Dontari Poe and Everson Griffen seemed like home run signings at the time, and Daryl Worley was a versatile veteran with proven results. Instead, none of these guys even made it to the bye week. It‚Äôs hard to pick which one of those was a bigger bust, but each of them underwhelming the way they did contributed in a big way to this defense‚Äôs slow (to put it politely) start to the year.The biggest surprise for me has been the immediate impact from this new class of rookies. First off all, it‚Äôs hard to remember the last time I was this excited about a draft haul. The new process of just letting Will McClay and his scouts do their job without so much outside interference from the coaching staff allowed them to take great pick after great pick back in April. And the guys they selected have wasted no time showing their ability. First-round gem CeeDee Lamb is as good as advertised as he leads the team in receiving touchdowns and is on pace to have over 1,000 yards receiving despite the offensive struggles without Dak Prescott. Before his injury, Trevon Diggs was showing everyone why he was in consideration as a potential first-round target. The Cowboys have found themselves a great no. 1 corner for the future. And while he might‚Äôve been thrown into action sooner than expected due to injuries, Tyler Biadasz has done a fantastic job holding down the center position for this team. Even Neville Gallimore is flashing some great playmaking ability as he‚Äôs now starting games and is coming off the best game of his young career. The Cowboys season has been very disappointing, but this young crop of rookies should make us feel great about the future.The player that has surprised me the most so far would be Dalton Schultz. We knew the Cowboys passing game was going to be a strength on this offense and we knew the coaching staff was excited that they had a stretch tight end like Blake Jarwin on the roster. But when Jarwin went down there was a real question about what they had behind him depth wise. We‚Äôll Schultz has stepped up to the challenge and been a reliable receiver for all four of the starting quarterbacks used this season. Making plays to move the chains or beating linebackers down the seem. Whatever they‚Äôve asked of him he has been able to provide.I would say my biggest surprise this season has been the complete devastation of the offensive line. It‚Äôs so easy to take something for granted when it‚Äôs so reliable, and that has been the unquestioned case with this O-line troupe. Travis Frederick‚Äôs retirement did come as a huge surprise to many including myself, but our remaining slew of Pro-Bowlers still left me with the utmost comfortability and confidence in Big D‚Äôs offense to move the ball downfield. Welp, minus one point for me in that regard. They began to drop like flies. The first man down was La‚Äôel Collins - whose season-ending hip surgery was made so much worse by Tyron Smith‚Äôs subsequent downfall in succession. Brandon Knight and Mitch Hyatt round out injured-reserve names, and now Frederick‚Äôs replacement Tyler Biadasz is out with a hamstring ailment. Huh, no wonder Zeke can‚Äôt seem to eat up yardage like he did in year‚Äôs past. We‚Äôve been so accustomed to seeing Elliott‚Äôs ‚Äúfeed me‚Äù celebration and the Cowboys‚Äô O-Line move opposing weight like they were operating a Brinks truck, that now their collapse is the worst thing imaginable - and then some. It‚Äôs like the nastiest knuckleball from the nosebleed bleachers in left field. A ‚Äúhumbling experience‚Äù is the best way I can adequately collectivize all of the chaos.The thing that surprised me most in the first half of the season is secondary‚Äôs struggles. Coming into the season, I was one who believed the offseason acquisitions could really improve the Cowboys‚Äô secondary. Losing All-Pro Byron Jones was a big hit, but I felt that a return of Anthony Brown, the addition of Daryl Worley, and rookies Trevon Diggs and Reggie Robinson being added to the fold could really soften the blow. Boy was I wrong. Other than Diggs, all three of the other corners have really struggled, or in Robinson‚Äôs case, not even seen the field. Worley was so poor he did not even make it to the bye week. Even Jourdan Lewis, a guy who came into the season with high expectations, has really struggled. The secondary cost Dallas a few games in the early going, and I really did not expect them to preform this poorly.Let us know what you think about our answers, and drop your biggest first half surprise in the comment section below."

The Cowboys also, for the first time in 10 years, brought in an entire new coaching staff that had to deal with the strangest offseason in years because of COVID.It‚Äôs a tough time for the Cowboys, and things may only get worse. The light at the end of the tunnel is a potential top-five pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, and the hope that their stars will recover and come back healthy next season.Despite the Cowboys shot at making the postseason being down the drain, there is still plenty to look back on through the first nine games of 2020. Today, we‚Äôll kick off our midseason review series, by having our front page writers answer the question, ‚Äúwho/what surprised you most in the first half?‚ÄùNow onto the BTB Writers biggest first half surprise....What most surprised me was the way the free agents that we talked ourselves into being so excited about turned into diddly and squat. Outside of Greg Zuerlein, there was almost nothing there. Everson Griffen was at times serviceable, but apparently not enough to keep around. Ha Ha Clinton-Dix couldn‚Äôt even make the roster out of camp. Brandon Carr couldn‚Äôt see eye to eye with the staff. Dontari Poe was just washed, and Gerald McCoy was lost to the first of the interminable injuries. While the names were better known, it was another trip to the remainders bin for the Cowboys, with results we should have seen coming. So being surprised was all on me, I guess.The thing that surprised me most was how badly the Cowboys struck out on their three defensive free agents. Dontari Poe and Everson Griffen seemed like home run signings at the time, and Daryl Worley was a versatile veteran with proven results. Instead, none of these guys even made it to the bye week. It‚Äôs hard to pick which one of those was a bigger bust, but each of them underwhelming the way they did contributed in a big way to this defense‚Äôs slow (to put it politely) start to the year."

But, as usual, you can count on Jerry Jones for a couple of sound bites. He was on 105.3 and was asked about Tony Pollard‚Äôs role in the offense. There have been many observers of the Cowboys making the case that Pollard should be getting more snaps, even if that means Ezekiel Elliott is getting fewer.It doesn‚Äôt sound like Jerry Jones is a big fan of that.‚ÄúTony‚Äôs not a Johnny come lately to our appreciate for what he can bring to us. It always was exponential his potential here to help us, not though, let me emphasize, not though, at the diminished times we get the ball in the hands of Zeke or get Zeke involved in the offense in a way that he influences the offense so we can make big plays,‚Äù Jones said on 105.3 The Fan when asked if Pollard should get more involved in the rushing attack. ‚ÄúAll of this is all around what we‚Äôre trying to do with our key spot at quarterback. I would say no in answer to any role that Pollard is being considered that would diminish anything that we‚Äôre doing with Zeke.‚ÄùBasically, if you don‚Äôt take away touches from Zeke, then you can‚Äôt really give more to Pollard unless the team suddenly ups the run output dramatically. That is unlikely to happen so it doesn‚Äôt seem like, at least from Jerry‚Äôs vantage point, that we can expect to see a significant uptick in Pollard‚Äôs usage.Which is a real shame. Pollard has easily been the most effective of the two backs and is the only one of the two likely to produce a big play by running the ball. There is an argument out there that Pollard‚Äôs effectiveness would go down if they used him more and that he is nothing more than a change of pace back. Why don‚Äôt we test that theory first before we believe in it? Just because Pollard has a different build and running style than Zeke, doesn't mean he can't be effective with more carries. To suggest that without actually testing it out seems a tad premature. We‚Äôll just have to wait and see what the coaching staff does when the Cowboys return to the field.On the other side of the ball, Jerry indicated the team would like to get Aldon Smith signed to another deal. That seemed obvious when they turned down reported trade offers for him at the trade deadline. Here‚Äôs what Jerry had to say when asked about that.‚ÄúYes, and the idea here is that Aldon is getting better,‚Äù Jones said Friday. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a bigger man than he was when he played earlier in his career. But that has a lot of positives to it, too. But every time he‚Äôs stepping out there, he‚Äôs gaining on it, and that‚Äôs interesting to be at this stage of his career. But he‚Äôs an absolute unique in every way pressure player. We want to maximize our relationship with him. We‚Äôve all got a good one with him. Proud of him. Proud for him. Proud that he‚Äôs given himself this chance, and we‚Äôre going to help him do it. So, as I‚Äôve said earlier, I‚Äôm a fan of his.‚ÄùSmith was on fire coming out of the start of the season, but has cooled somewhat since. As has been noted many times, sacks are not the ‚Äúeverything‚Äù for a defensive end, but let‚Äôs face it, sacks are what those players get paid for. Playing the run and getting pressure and the like are important, but the big payoff are sacks. They are momentum-changers, drive-killers, and turnover-makers.Smith started the year with four sacks in the first three games. Since then, he has only added one more sack. Most of his numbers - TFLs, QB hits, etc. - are in decline. But, he has been active and he does look like he‚Äôs on the edge of becoming a disruptive player at the position. The Cowboys would be wise to get him under contract for a few more years at a reasonable rate."

In fact, the latest Elf on a Shelf just arrived, and I must say...I‚Äôm a little unsettled.Special 2020 Edition Elf on a Shelf, hurry and buy while supplies last! pic.twitter.com/mqZaRETBGFThe 2020 season has been dreadful, and there is nothing more we can do but put on our brave faces to get through these final seven games. Next season will bring a clean slate that will hopefully consist of a healthy and wealthy Dak Prescott behind center. With a new season also brings with it some bright spots from the current one. Yes, there have been some good things this year. Here are five players who are performing a lot better than most people expected.The Cowboys top two draft picks have been fantastic this season as they have stepped right into the starters role and haven‚Äôt disappointed. Both have had a few growing pains along the way, but it seems favorable that these two guys are going to shine in this league. Lamb has star potential, and Diggs continued to improve with each new game, although that progress will be hindered as he‚Äôll now miss the next 4-6 weeks with a foot injury.While they have been great, they don‚Äôt make our list because we had already placed rather high expectations on them.This is more of a testament to the coaching staff for getting the third-year receiver involved in the offense. We all expected the big three of Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup, and Lamb to handle the bulk of the work, and they are. Wilson‚Äôs target share pales in comparison to those guys, but he‚Äôs done a really nice job making them count. He‚Äôs caught 15 passes for 179 yards, and two touchdowns. And thanks to his high-school quarterbacking skills, he‚Äôs thrown a touchdown pass to Prescott and had a nice lateral toss on a trick punt return play.For Wilson, health has been his biggest obstacle. He missed his entire rookie season as well as 10 games last year. But this season, he‚Äôs been healthy, and we‚Äôve been able to see what he can contribute to this offense, and it‚Äôs been great.If this list was put together after Week 3, the veteran pass rusher would be sitting at the top as he led the league with four sacks at that time. Since then, he‚Äôs cooled off as his snap counts have gone from 60+ per game to the low 40‚Äôs. But even still, the 31-year-old edge rusher has done a great job showing he still has a lot to offer after being out of action the last four seasons.Smith still leads the team in sacks with five and in quarterback hits with nine. The return of Randy Gregory does create a log jam at right defensive end as the team continues to try to assemble the best pass rushing arrangement. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for him as he hits unrestricted free agency next season, but the Cowboys are certainly getting their money worth this year.Which would you rather have:

Robert Quinn (1 sack this year) for $14 million a year

OR

Aldon Smith (5 sacks this year) for $2 millionLet me be the first to offer up my sincere apologies for the immediate disdain I had for this free agent signing. The team gave him a one-year, $2.5 million deal which was fine; however, $2 million of it was guaranteed. This appeared like throwing money away because nothing on his tape recently brought about good vibes that he could handle the swing tackle position. Not only that, but my flag was firmly planted on Team Brandon Knight as last year‚Äôs UDFA rookie showed some nice promise when called upon.Surprisingly, Erving has been really effective this year. A knee injury back in Week 1 (on a special teams play) sidelined him for the first part of the year. He healed up in the nick of time to fill in for Knight, who has missed the last three games with a knee injury of his own. There are moments on tape where Erving loses his matchup, but it‚Äôs not often, and it‚Äôs not so bad that it stops the offense from functioning.Honestly, all three of the backup tackles belong on this list as they‚Äôve played way beyond what one could expect. Knight and Terrence Steele are both UDFA‚Äôs, so when you combine that with their overall rawness, it‚Äôs hard not to be impressed. But credit Erving for holding down the left tackle spot pretty well in recent weeks. This might seem a little too much praise for a guy who has only played three games, but that left tackle position is pretty darn important.We could do a whole write-up on Cowboys backup offensive linemen who have been thrown into a starting role this season. Go down the line and you‚Äôll find players who have filled in admirably for this team. Wisconsin‚Äôs rookie center Tyler Biadasz is at the top of that list. A knee injury to Joe Looney in Week 4 against the Cleveland Browns forced Biadasz into action sooner than expected. There have been a few hiccups as sometimes he‚Äôs a little slow snapping the ball to where the rest of the offensive line gets called for a false start. But overall, the rookie has performed well and looks to be a solid fixture in the Cowboys offensive line going forward.The front office jumped at the opportunity to trade up to land Biadasz after he fell late in the fourth round. It was a wise move. There were much bigger names (Cesar Ruiz, Matt Hennessy, and Lloyd Cushenberry) drafted ahead of Biadasz, but it‚Äôs the Cowboys center who made PFF‚Äôs midseason all-rookie team.It‚Äôs hard to figure out if the Schultz emergence has more to do with something just clicking for him, or if the previous coaching staff just never gave him much of a shot. And to be quite honest, his skill set could‚Äôve easily been hidden again had it not been for the unfortunate season-ending injury to Blake Jarwin in the season opener.Schultz has been a reliable target for whomever is quarterbacking this team. He‚Äôs caught 35 passes for 383 yards, which is already more than Jarwin had in either of his two previous seasons. Granted, Jarwin was stuck behind Jason Witten last year, so that‚Äôs not an apples to apples comparison. The only thing we do know is that Schultz has played extremely well as the team‚Äôs lead tight end. His ability as a pass catcher was a complete surprise as he‚Äôs demonstrated none of those skills in seasons past. He runs good routes, he shows good hands, and he sneaks in over the seam as well as anyone.Probably my most unpopular Cowboys take from 2020. pic.twitter.com/fvEdzwcpPBIt‚Äôs not fair to just Wally Pipp Jarwin like that as we never got to see him cut loose in the lead tight end role. Who‚Äôs to say he doesn‚Äôt flourish? But with what Schultz has shown as a receiver combined with his more skilled ability as an inline blocker, this is one battle to keep an eye on next season."

Let‚Äôs see what he had to say. (All answers are paraphrased and not actual quotes).Mike McCarthy noted that obviously it is nice that the team is technically in a competitive place, and that the state of the division is obvious. He said that you go through different facts and details of the situation as a group, but that the bulk of the team‚Äôs focus and majority of messaging is on self-improvement. He noted that this is what the bye week is about and that he is hopeful the team came away with that impression.McCarthy noted that the Cowboys had a mock game-type practice on Monday and that Andy Dalton was a full participant and that he had a good day. When asked about Dalton starting, he said they would have to get through the whole week of practice first.The Dallas Cowboys saw their Covid-19 protocols upped in intensity last week as a result of the Pittsburgh Steelers dealing with matters related to it. He noted that the Cowboys really only lost Wednesday‚Äôs practice as far as logistics are concerned. He added that the team will be working from The Star this week and that the facility fortunately has a vast amount of space so the team can continue to adhere to social distancing protocols.McCarthy said the biggest thing they would like on offense is to get some continuity and efficiency there. He noted that special teams has had a fairly settled unit, and defense has picked up the last two weeks as they have started to settle their combinations. But on offense, he said the different QBs and the offensive line combinations has made it difficult and that is what he hopes settles down going forward.Asked if the Cowboys players had a particular pep in their steam on Monday as a direct result of Sunday‚Äôs results within the NFC East, McCarthy said that energy was definitely high, but that he doesn‚Äôt believe it was necessarily in relation to Week 10‚Äôs action. He thought it was from the team being well-rested after the bye week.McCarthy noted that he has not been cleared to re-join the team at this time, but he is hopeful that Crawford will be ready in the next few days.McCarthy noted that Chido looked great on Monday at the practice and he is hopeful that Awuzie will play this week.Coach noted that it was a big blow and that Diggs has been one of the best players on the defense and that he‚Äôs been impactful. He said it‚Äôs a multi-week injury and that the next player would have to step up.It is obviously possible that Andy Dalton will start at quarterback for the team on Sunday in Minnesota. McCarthy noted that he believes Andy is in fine shape and is a professional and should be ready if that‚Äôs the case.Coach thinks they have been playing their techniques better and getting off blocks better while also pursuing the ball. He thinks they are playing with more energy on the techniques, and that guys are getting used to the scheme and with each other."

You could also go with the overall performance of the defensive line, a unit that seemed to be a strength coming into the season, but has severely underperformed as a group.On a 2-7 team, there‚Äôs plenty of blame to go around, and lots of players who have been a disappointment.Now onto the BTB Writers biggest first half disappointment....My biggest disappointment has to be the injuries. We never got to see what this roster, especially the offense, was truly capable of. With both starting OTs out, soon to be joined by Blake Jarwin and Dak Prescott, things just collapsed for the team. We thought this was a very talented bunch of players. We usually overestimate that, but this year, we never had a chance to see just how good they might have been. Prescott was of course the biggest blow, as even with the severe issues surrounding him, he was on track to have a monster season. To miss so many games with what is one of the best sets of WRs in the league is just cruel, to him, the team, and the fans.Jaylon Smith definitely disappointed me the most. I was expecting him to be take a huge step forward in this defense, and he didn‚Äôt. Part of that is due to the poor play of the defensive tackles, but Smith has also routinely walked himself into blocks or been completely out of position on plays. Smith also discussed the complexity of the defense and how it‚Äôs affected his play.Cowboys LB Jaylon Smith said the defense ""absolutely"" could benefit by simplifying Mike Nolan's scheme. ""Just allowing us more opportunity to (hone) in on what we're actually going to run in our game plan. ...With a smaller playbook, it gives us better opportunity to do that.""I was a fan of Smith‚Äôs coming into this season but I‚Äôve been so disappointed by his performance that I can‚Äôt argue bringing him back next year.The biggest disappointment to me is the poor play of the defense, in particular - Jaylon Smith. We knew coming into this year that there were going to be some growing pains with a defensive coaching makeover, but I couldn‚Äôt have predicted it would be this excruciating. The injuries are plentiful and the team has gotten next to nothing from their free agent acquisitions, but the thing that caught me the most off guard was 54‚Äôs performance. Jaylon just looks like a rookie out there. His reaction is slow, his decision making is sketchy, he‚Äôs often running in the wrong direction, and even when he almost makes a nice play, he ends up getting flagged for some cheap penalty. If it was happening here and there, we could get mad at the officiating, or chalk it up to ‚Äúeveryone makes mistakes.‚Äù However, it‚Äôs a regular thing with him. I love the guy as a person, but his performance combined with the unpredictable health of Leighton Vander Esch has me putting a top collegiate linebacker atop my draft wish list.The biggest disappointment for me through the first half of the season would have to be the play of the safeties. Xavier Woods and Darian Thompson weren‚Äôt playing sound defense and we‚Äôre continually caught out of position or looking at the quarterback instead of focusing on receivers. This led to big plays for opposing teams and would take the wind out of a defense that was already struggling to stop teams. The Cowboys were wise enough to make a change, replacing Thompson with Donovan Wilson and that change has improved the play of the safeties. Hopefully they can keep that going throughout the rest of the season.My biggest disappointment through the first half of the season has to be Jaylon Smith. After a rough year in 2019, I really believed Smith would rebound big in 2020. So far, it‚Äôs been about the opposite. Smith has looked, at times, worse than he did last season, and his ability to go sideline to sideline seems to keep getting worse. Now you can‚Äôt put all the blame on Smith. The Dallas defensive tackles have been getting blown off the ball all season, making it hard for the linebackers to be free to make plays, but Smith has to be better. With the money the Cowboys are paying him, Smith needs to be a difference maker. Currently, he‚Äôs not.The biggest disappointment is the failure of much of the Cowboys outside free agent class, besides Greg Zuerlein and Aldon Smith. The Cowboys signed Gerald McCoy and Dontari Poe to shore up the middle of the defense and McCoy never got on the field because of injury while Poe was released for poor play. Everson Griffen was supposed to add to a pass rush that was thought to be a force, but the Cowboys ended up trading him for a late-round draft pick. Ha Ha Clinton-Dix never even made the final roster. Corner Daryl Worley was also dumped. They really struck out on many of their outside free agents, meanwhile they let Byron Jones get away and didn't sign Dak Prescott long-term. Disappointing.Let us know what you think about our answers, and drop your biggest first half disappointment in the comment section below."

The focus of this little screed is on things pro football, some specific to the Cowboys, and others just about the game in general. With the bye week and the slow flow of news, it‚Äôs time for a vent.It‚Äôs an accepted thing for Dallas, and really for most franchises. If you have a player on a big contract, he‚Äôs going to get playing time, even if it is at the cost of giving those snaps to someone who may be more productive. There are three clear examples on the Cowboys right now.Ezekiel Elliott is still the starter, including last game against the Pittsburgh Steelers when he was nursing a hamstring issue. He got 65% of the snaps, while Tony Pollard was on the field for 32% of the offensive plays. Yet Pollard had more yards rushing, due to him averaging 6.3 yards a carry to Elliott‚Äôs 2.8.Raw stats don‚Äôt tell the entire story, of course, but it is notable that while Elliott has struggled to get many long gains at all this year, Pollard had two totes that went for 20 yards in the game. I‚Äôm no coach, but it seems mystifying why the team doesn‚Äôt put Pollard out there more to see if this is indicative of him just having more burst and ability to get through the hole. But Elliott represents a $10.9 million cap hit, and we can‚Äôt have that sitting on the bench. Or so the reasoning goes.A second example is the stated intention to start Andy Dalton instead of Garrett Gilbert. Gilbert was much, much better against Pittsburgh than just about anything we would have imagined. Ownership cites Dalton‚Äôs career record after his almost decade as the starter for the Cincinnati Bengals, but at the moment, he stands at a pretty mediocre 70-63-2. While he certainly has proven he is not trash, and had some fairly bad supporting casts at times, he is not exactly overwhelmingly good. But his $3 million guaranteed salary seems to be a factor in the decision.Linebacker Jaylon Smith may be making a ton of tackles, but he is also missing a lot of plays. He seems lost at times, and in other instances he just seems to freelance. But he also has a huge paycheck, and is on the field for almost every play. His performance should warrant less time, especially with Sean Lee healthy again, but that is not how he is being handled.While Mike McCarthy may or may not agree with the approach, there is little doubt that it originates with Jerry and Stephen Jones. It permeates much of the league, and likely comes from the ownership in other organizations as well.It has nothing to do with what is best for the team on the field. It is thinking driven by financials and sunk costs. If a team wants to win, it should always play the best players. If it is trying to figure out what it has for the future in a lost season, which is almost certainly the case for Dallas, then the younger players should be seeing more snaps as well.Just because owners are billionaires with absolute money-printing machines in their teams, that doesn‚Äôt mean they are smart. Many are second-generation owners who inherited their teams and wealth. Others made their fortunes in other businesses. The skills or traits that led to their riches don‚Äôt necessarily carry over to the NFL.Here, Gilbert is a prime example of what could be. He was very successful in the short-lived AAF, and that seems to have carried over into his performance in his first NFL action after that. Before, he had not seen much action at all in the NFL. The AAF game him an opportunity to hone his skills, and he did just that.The investment in supporting such a league would be fairly small in the overall scheme of things. And the AAF was a ready-made way to do just that. Of course, it would have come out of the bottom line of the league. Those owners I was complaining about above are very resistant to investing money in something that doesn‚Äôt contribute to the bottom line. But the AAF might have grown into a profit source, especially if the NFL had worked with broadcasters to give them a product for the offseason. Football is the ratings king of all pro sports, and given time, that could have turned into a nice secondary revenue stream.It would be nice to have a ready pool of talent with on-field experience they can‚Äôt gain in the NFL. Some vision and innovation could pay big dividends. It just doesn‚Äôt seem to be in the cards, however, and that is a shame.This not to say the Cowboys were robbed of a major upset victory against the Steelers, but it was not made any easier by some of the questionable calls, or non-calls, by the refs. Amari Cooper was obviously interfered with/held on the interception that killed a great scoring opportunity for Dallas. And then a very marginal call against Jaylon Smith kept a Pittsburgh scoring drive alive.A solution is hard to come by. Reviewing calls would slow the game down, and there is no guarantee that a review official would be willing to overturn the judgment of the zebras on the field. The experiment with making pass interference reviewable was a failure and died a deserved quick death.Apparently there is a need for more training, and the idea of going to full time officials at all positions might be a step in the right direction. It‚Äôs another place that the developmental league I argued for would be a great way to get more reps for the referees, who would likely benefit just like the players.But for some time, the Cowboys have been the team that is more penalized than any other in the NFL, and that seems to be something more than coaching or player discipline. If they were on the other side of this equation, then it wouldn‚Äôt be so galling."

It isn't that I hadn't thought to join it before, but rather that I had just stumbled upon it and found it very exciting! Here was a place where I could be kept deeply informed on a daily basis on the team both day-to-day and in the bigger picture, plus engage in discussions in article comments and even my own authored posts...what could be better?

As much as I've enjoyed the past nearly six full years as part of this dedicated community, I can't help but agree with the general perception that the state of dialogue among us has steadily worsened over that time frame. It isn't so easy to spot through any given snapshot, but the shift can be felt most harshly by looking back on the comments of older articles. It hit me one (pre-Coral, not sure old comments are yet available again) day when I was reviewing something from an early Fanpost of mine...going through the comments, it was filled with classic sports-talk conversation, with lots of diving into the meat and potatoes of what I had written about, including some respectful debate. Even looking back on it, it was a joy to read again, reminding me of had not just inspired me to join in the first place but also to look to share some detailed perspectives of my own.

But it very much has shifted. I don't know why...perhaps because entering 2015 feelings were broadly positive and so folks had more rope to give the team or the negative takes simply didn't have much purchase? Or maybe there has been a shift in the mindset of the typical Dallas Cowboys fan? Has the makeup of the active community changed? Or is this indicative of (and thus the result of) a broader change in the manner of our current society, embittered by partisanship and long-running dissatisfactions broad to a head and so on? Something else? It's beyond me, and doesn't have to be to anyone's blame, though I'd hope we as a group would want to shift from such a course.

But it hit me pretty hard to see the following in the comments of a recent FP article...comments in which I wasn't even yet joined in the discussion:That'll wake you up with more of a jolt than the biggest cup of coffee ever will. So, to review, here's what has been accomplished above by some understandably dissatisfied Cowboy fans:
1) Feeling that the Cowboys are closer to a total rework than the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Perfectly fair perspective!
2) Implying that (and thereby insulting) anyone who thinks otherwise isn't a ""smart"" football fan.
3) Suggesting that Jerry and Stephen Jones are not ""smart"" football fans, delusional, and thus presumably also believe that the Cowboys are ""Super Bowl bound"" next year.
4) Lumping me in at random and in driveby fashion.Forget the last part for a second...but the second and third ones are really, really not a good thing for civil conversation. #2's issues probably go without saying, but...the proliferation of takes that follow along with #3 are a bad sign. One can and should disagree with the actions of the leadership of the Cowboys all one wants...but having to resort to personal attacks in the form of namecalling? The community guidelines call for a prohibition on personal attacks, and some (I suppose, feeling that personal attacks do not reflect negatively on themselves) will self-excuse all sorts of namecalling of someone like Jerry Jones on the basis of ""that only applies to attacking people here, not public figures"". Sure, that may literally be true, but...do some here really not understand why personal attacks are frowned upon? It isn't just about ""face to face"" civility, but also about civility of the content of dialogue. The moment a person shifts from ""here is why I think Jerry Jones is running the team the wrong way"" to ""Jerry Jones is a moron who doesn't know football"", it isn't just that the conversation has suffered a drop in language, but really that conversation has ended outright...because those kinds of attacks lack in substance and support. It's an admission of ""I can't be bothered to prove this very negative (note: which doesn't mean it isn't true) perspective with facts, probably because it's too negative to be true, so I'm just going to rubber stamp this with an insult"". It's a less extreme version of ""playing the Hitler Card"" - it isn't the same and thus doesn't crash the conversation as badly to a halt as the Card does, but in the end in has the same affect.

But the comment didn't stop there. Apparently, there was room to drag me into it, hitting below the belt in the worst of fashions. And it's shameful. There was a time when such a comment would be rare, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. So...where does it go wrong?
1) Even if the comment were accurate, it's pretty terrible. While some might try to excuse the comments as not being personal attacks due to the insult itself being implied instead of stated...well, the inference is clear, and the inference is a black-and-white personal attack. So, we've reached the point that some are not just labeling others ""not smart"" and ""delusional"", but we're even doing it in fresh conversations without the labelee being present? Ugh.

I'd be curious to hear how anyone who wrote one of those comments (note: please do NOT go looking for the identities of anyone involved; this was not written to try to direct attention to any individuals), gave any ""rec"", or even just nodded in agreement at home would justify the place for that here. Do you honestly believe that the insult was both valid and in keeping with community guidelines? If in retrospect you don't believe one or both of those...does it feel wrong now? Regrettable? Shameful? I hope so...because, if so, there's hope we can start to do better, together.

2) The comment couldn't even be bothered to be even slightly accurate. This is the part when such rough behavior becomes a double-whammy: it isn't just rough community behavior, but even if that sort of behavior were allowed it's straight-up false. Bad enough to insult someone...but to insult someone in an imaginary way?

Woe that such a comment would be made and thus that I would have to ""defend"" myself, but here we are. So...I'm a great, big, delusional homer? That's the claim yes? That thinking should reach a quick end simply by referencing some of the Fanposts (forget the many comments beyond them) I've written here:
Why Drafting Ezekiel Elliott Would Be A Major Mistake - laying the groundwork ahead of time for why I did not like the idea of Dallas drafting Elliott
Well, that was fun while it lasted - how I saw the Elliott pick and near-trade-up for Paxton Lynch as a clear sign that Jerry Jones had taken the front office reins back, and how bad that would be if true
Please help talk me off the ledge - I go on the record about my clear ""misery"" (yes, as upset as anyone here likely has been about anything Dallas related) about the Elliott pick. Useful lesson: even being so confident that the pick was a huge missed opportunity, I did not rant and rave against the team or front office personally, and was still open-minded enough to ask the community to try to talk me into tempering my negativity. As a bonus, I also wrote ""And worse yet, I know there is no way for Elliot to be bad enough to ever be seen as a disappointment, thanks to Dallas's OL, so he is going to get all sorts of praise anyways."" This was not something I wanted to be correct about...but oh well
Are you ready to wake up, or will you continue to keep your head in the sand? - says it all: ""Starting with the 49er game, Dallas has been winning in spite of Dak Prescott's mediocre passing. And I'm not bashing Prescott; I love him."" That was composed back in 2016 during his overly-praised rookie year...what a homer and non-smart football fan I am, for being able to (spot on) be critical of the weaknesses in Prescott's game even while being happy with what he had quickly brought to the team. Yes, it is possible to be positive and pleased and still offer constructive criticism
Now we have the evidence that has been requested - laying out, without qualifiers, how Prescott was not nearly at Romo's level as of the end of 2016, and how that meant the 2016 team wasn't as good as it could be
Understanding ""why"" Dallas lost against GB - in comments leading up to the 2016 playoff game, I had laid out the ""blueprint"" for a Cowboy playoff loss, centering on Dak Prescott. In this piece, written after the loss, I broke down in detail how that blueprint had indeed come to pass. Sigh
Things I know I think in the wake of Bryant's release - see item #6 in the post: ""I think my former firm faith in Dallas's front office is reeling""
A little reminder, for those who are already jumping ship - after the Week 1 loss to the Panthers to open 2018, I wrote ""Does this mean I can promise you that the offensive mediocrity we saw yesterday will fade as execution improves? No, it absolutely does not."" The piece was a response NOT urging people to not be critical of the Dallas defeat, but rather disagreeing with some particular specific criticisms. There was plenty to worry about, even just one week in
The road ahead - one week later, following a win, ""Don't cozy up in bed thinking that Dallas has everything figured out and is good to go, but if you were especially concerned a week ago you should be able to table those worries for now. Let the early season unfold for the next few weeks, and figure that we'll be a great position to have a sense of this squad by the time it gets its week off.""
I now urge everyone to change their thinking about this season, and instead aim to enjoy the ride - with 2018 looking up and down, I suggest being less ""all or nothing"" and instead enjoying the ride with the team, good and bad. At the time, I did not have an overall positive or negative feeling about the team
An Amari Cooper Q&A - in which I expressed, among many other things, that I felt it would be very difficult for this deal to fully pay back its price, even if it overall worked out
Assorted thoughts in the aftermath of a season-crippling loss - still mid-2018, ""Given the mountain of a task Dallas has in front of it to win next week...this loss means the playoffs - and so, the season - is pretty much toast...If this team wants to show something, it should go out an find a way to win next week. It has no right or reason to beat the Eagles, so if the Cowboys managed to pull it off it would change...well, a lot. But I'm not holding my breath on that one..."" Imagine being this sold that the team was set for one more loss that would pretty much end a shot at the playoffs, and yet rather than rant about the failures of the front office or coaching staff or players I still instead basically ask the team to go and show me something. As we now know, it went on to do just that
I think this Bears drive to open the second half just broke my spirit - mid 2019, ""We know that mistakes have been difference-makers (and even outright game killers) all season, but I've been hopeful that things would come together sooner or later...But the opening drive by the Bears coming out of halftime has driven that hope into the ground."" Writing in real time about my shift from uncertain-but-hopeful to convinced that the team did not have ""it"" for the season
Tales of the tape: the defense in the Cleveland game - breaking down the first contest in which Dallas's defense seemed to slide even further than it had already started in 2020
2020 Q1 review: how did my bag of Twizzlers end up half black licorice? - written at the 2020 quarter mark, ""Please take care to not see this piece as presenting, much less pushing, a positive outlook. Frankly, there is no positive outlook."" Delusions in full swing, I guess?I hope at this point the track record speaks for itself, but just in case here's the summary of my approach: I look to analyze and present truths while questioning presumptions, good or bad. If I see negative, I speak to the negative, and if I see positive I speak to the positive. Most of all, if I still see a foggy outlook, I PUSH that the outlook is foggy, rather than positive or negative. That's a position that we seem to hear less and less of nowadays.

Understand something: I share plenty of negative and positive takes that I don't ever write about here...because why repeat what is broadly agreed upon? Do I need to browbeat how bad Jaylon Smith has been? Trumpet repeatedly about Tyler Biadasz's strong near-future outlook? Harp on Dak Prescott not leading a target well on a short route? Nah. I tend to write when I discover something not already discussed, fact-check a presumption (not because I am convinced that the presumption is true or false, but because I want to find out either way and then share the findings), or most of all when someone takes a reasonable opinion and then pushes it too far, such as taking the truth that Dak Prescott is off-target on shorter routes at a relatively higher rate among solid-or-better starting QBs and then labeling him a ""mediocre"" overall QB on the basis that he ""can't lead a receiver"" and high quality QBs almost always do.

Look at what has happened here. It's bad - lazy, childish, and almost always just not true - to blanket insult people with labels, even the ones who aren't ""present"". It's worse to insult members of the active community with personal attack labels. It's just as bad to, for whatever reason, misrepresent the takes of other members of the community. So...just how bad is it to personally attack a community member on the basis of an indefensibly-inaccurate misrepresentation of that person's opinions? And...have we even hit rock bottom? Will this become more frequent, or more venomous, or perhaps discover new means of sinking even lower?

To anyone who reads this and realizes he or she took part in the above and now regrets it: if you want to help stem yourself from such hiccups, and in doing so reverse the course where this is headed, I have a suspicion/theory about what is leading to this sort of outcome. Here's what I think is happening: a person is unhappy with the team (as I always try to attach to that observation there is every fair reason to feel that way). In one's unhappiness, one for whatever reason responds with negative opinions, some reasonable and some not. But if I (or others) explain how the unreasonable opinions are not reasonable, and one allows oneself to respect that I am coming from an honest and fair and informed place, that now means the unreasonable opinions are ""wrong"" enough to leave behind...and that would drive one to feel less negatively about the team.

Apparently, that is unacceptable - as, for some reason, one wants not just to feel reasonably negative about the team but as negative as possible. Thus, the only way to then reconcile the unreasonable negative takes and their reasonable counters is to do whatever possible to see the unreasonable as reasonable. And, because reasonable counters work hard to carefully lay out the counter with reasoning and support (and thus are difficult to invalidate, because they probably are indeed valid), rather than try to conjure up a counter-counterargument that doesn't exist...it's much easier to counter the response by, in one's mind, invalidating the speaker.

How does one invalidate a speaker, rightly or (more commonly) wrongly? Paint in one's mind that the person has an agenda, or is a homerish ""kool aid drinker"", or has no idea what he or she is talking about, even if none of that lines up with the actual written record of the arguments the speaker has made. That's the trouble with today's dialogue: any given person can simply choose to ignore the actual record. There was a time, I think, when people would be chided for not making much effort to fact-check claims...but nowadays, when convenient people won't even bother to fact-check what they think are even the stated beliefs of others. Fill in those blanks, even when the speaker has already explicitly filled in the ""blanks"" in a different way.

It's ultimately a falling-short of empathy. I guess it can't be bothered for some to put themselves in my shoes and consider my at-least potential sincerity. That's the sad and funny thing in all of this...it's hard for folks to even get tone right. This post has been written in a sad, quiet, paced tone, but if someone consciously or by accident assigns it an angry, aggressive, ranting tone? Now my motivations have been shifted to other than where they actually came from, and there is little I can do about that.

Want ""proof"" of my motivations? Just look at the caveat I gave above, one that I always hold: I never, ever try to invalidate someone else's reasonable right to feel disappointed or unhappy about this football team. I get that you feel that way, and I RESPECT it (and often share it). I have been accused (totally unfairly) of taking an arrogant position of looking down on others, of ""being smarter than the rest of us"", when in fact the reason I've (wasted?) spent so much time trying to explain all of this, granting the reasonable complaints while speaking firmly against the unreasonable ones, is precisely because I am no higher than anyone else here. I understand that emotions can lead people down an unreasonable path...and understanding that doesn't mean I look down on it! On the contrary! But just because I understand why a person does something ""wrong"" and don't judge it doesn't mean I won't try to ""fix"" the issue. If a person is editing other's writing, peer to peer, there is no judgement for saying ""oh, sorry, that isn't the proper grammar/editing style for publication/etc""...it's just matter of fact. But if the person being edited responds, incorrectly, with insistence that no fix is needed...what does the editor then do? Well, stay firm, try to explain differently, and try to cite more support...it isn't disrespect, but that doesn't change the reality that (assuming the fix is indeed correct) the fix is what it needs to be.So...what now? For anyone who bought into the personal attack cited in this post, do you understand my mind even a little better, or at least see the darkness suggested at by the personal attack? That darkness is real - I was personally attacked, and the thinking of ""mine"" that insult targeted is completely false. Does the community desire to work to avoid this sort of thing, and address clearly when it does...or is this the new status quo?

You don't have to take my word for it that the personal attack indeed suggests that at times people here are unconsciously working to undermine the motivations/capacities of those ""against"" them in order to cling to emotion-fueled negative thinking. But I hope we can agree on two things: 1) There is no need to respond to anything with a personal attack. Declare that the position someone else is taking is invalid or lacks support, if that is how you feel...that isn't personal. Stay in the scope of debate. 2) While there should rarely be reason to reference the track record of someone else, if and when going down that route work to respect that person enough to understand his or her mind before speaking about it. Want to know a crazeeeeee technique you can use to accomplish that, one that I often look to employ even as it is rarely used to my benefit? If not sure where a person's mind stands...just ask! And that's the thing: if you respect the other members of the community enough to take the time to ask for their clarifications, that also suggests you're making the effort to be thoughtful and fair in the discussion, in general.

Fingers crossed...Another user-created commentary provided by a BTB reader."

The team - which has consistently opted to stay away from blockbuster free agent deals through the past few off-seasons (Earl Thomas is the most prominent of several names that fit this description) - finally bit the bullet this past summer and opened their checkbooks to incumbent playmakers.They inked deals with a bevy of the market‚Äôs more high-caliber weapons, including Ha Ha Clinton-Dix, Aldon Smith, Dontari Poe and Everson Griffen.The result was a rarity for the Jones family - a full-on wheel-and-deal rendezvous in hopes to strengthen their front line with enough stability to make a deep push into the playoffs.We know now that‚Äôs about as wishful a thought as lottery-winning daydreams. And when their fort began to cave in as the season wore on, the Cowboys‚Äô front office had no choice but to surrender a few of their men to battle.They parted ways with both Poe and Griffen, who at that point had done very little to live up to the hype that had paraded them into town. Their jobs on Dallas‚Äô defensive line were simple: Poe was to use every ounce of his gaudy 6‚Äô3, 346-lb frame to cause enormous commotion inside, while Griffen, who had knowingly digressed due to age, was going to be counted on to resurface some rendition of the sack prowess that had wafted him to four Pro Bowl appearances.Neither did anything of the sort.Poe was labeled out of shape by several defensive coaches, and found himself thrust out of countless A-gap holes that led to gargantuan opposing rushing outputs. Griffen, on the other hand, was a step too slow in far too many plays that required his vanquishing abilities, and at times looked as if he were running with cement blocks bound to his ankles as quicker running backs scurried out of his clutches.And both were none too surprised when janitor Jones came sweeping in to clean up their mess, shipping both out of the Star with rapidity.The newly-freed roster spots not only gave Dallas‚Äô front office breathing room in their pockets, but provided lesser-known greenhorns with ample playing time to make a lasting impression.One such rookie is Neville Gallimore.""Gallimore having an outstanding game."" ‚Äî Tony Romo#OUDNA x @Path2Greatwork pic.twitter.com/Dhzy9Giy5zGallimore, who measures out much thinner than Poe‚Äôs massive girth at 302 lbs, makes up for it with a sneaky-sly nimbleness, and quick-twitch dexterity that rivals athletes much smaller than him in size.But don't let that fool you. He‚Äôs still a mammoth of a man, and his ability to go both through, and around opposing blockers will serve the Cowboys well as this marathon season wears on.Tony Pollard only had nine carries but went for a game-high 57 yards. A look at the circumstance of each carry.

Neville Gallimore showed up big time in the run and pass defense, such as rocking five-time All-Pro Maurkice Pouncey, as seen below.

https://t.co/exroc22oK7 pic.twitter.com/jL0nFzObciLittle has been unearthed of the 23-year-old Oklahoma product in terms of stat sheet production. In fact, he just recently earned his playing wings in the ‚ÄòBoys Week 5 matchup vs. the Giants. Gallimore finished with just one tackle in 22 snaps, but saw that number balloon to four with one stop in the backfield (38 snaps) vs. Washington, and three, plus another tackle for loss in their Pittsburgh standoff.His opportunities only project to go up from here.And with little else to look forward to, perhaps Gallimore can be one of this year‚Äôs feel-good stories that lightens a murky outlook."
728,cowboys,https://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2020/11/13/21562787/start-or-sit-nfl-fantasy-football-tips-for-week-10#comments,Start or Sit? NFL fantasy football tips for Week 10,"FILED UNDER:What players make the cut in this week‚Äôs start/sit list?It‚Äôs already Week 10 of the 2020 NFL season, which means there are only a few weeks remaining in the fantasy football regular season. As games become more and more meaningful, it‚Äôs important to fill out that starting lineup to maximum efficiency. Each week we‚Äôre faced with some tough choices as deciding which fringe players to insert into your lineup isn‚Äôt always cut and dry. So, we‚Äôre here to help you out with this week‚Äôs fantasy start/sit suggestions.Jared Goff (Rams) vs. Seattle Seahawks (Week 10 position rank: 10th)It‚Äôs just become a regular thing for the opposing quarterback of the Seahawks to have big games as their defense gives up a ridiculous amount of fantasy points to the position. After failing to get inside the top 15 QB finishes the previous four weeks, the Bills‚Äô Josh Allen returned to relevance with a top 2 finish last week. That‚Äôs what facing the Seahawks will do for you. Jared Goff is just a middling fantasy quarterback that mostly finishes somewhere between 10 and 20, so he doesn‚Äôt bring a lot of excitement to your fantasy lineup, but that could change this week.Joe Burrows (Bengals) vs. Pittsburgh Steelers (Week 10 position rank: 17th)Fantasy owners have been pleased with the rookie because he throws the ball a ton. Between yardage and touchdowns, Burrows has been able to put together a solid fantasy season. He‚Äôs just a couple weeks removed from a 404-yard, four-touchdown performance where he finished as the fourth-best scoring fantasy QB for the week. That‚Äôs what he can do with a great matchup. Unfortunately, this week is not so great as he faces a Steelers defense that is the best in the league at getting after the quarterback. When Burrows faced the Ravens earlier in the year, Burrows was shut down as it was the only game this season he hasn‚Äôt thrown a touchdown in and he only had 183 yards passing. With a shaky offensive line, this one could be a little bumpy for this year‚Äôs no. 1 overall pick.Leonard Fournette (Bucs) vs. Carolina Panthers (Week 10 position rank: 15th)It has to be frustrating if you own any of the Bucs running backs as you never know what you‚Äôre going to get during any given game. But what we can tell you is that the Panthers surrender the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing running backs. With both Ronald Jones and Fournette likely seeing a fair dose of touches, the opportunity is there for either of them to have a big game. And don‚Äôt be discouraged by last week‚Äôs shutdown as the Saints front seven is much more dominant than the Panthers. The last time these two teams squared off, Fournette ran for 102 yards on just 12 carries and scored twice, making him the fourth-highest scoring RB for the week. Even without an abundance of work, don‚Äôt be shocked if he puts up a similar performance.Jerick McKinnon (49ers) vs. New Orleans Saints (Week 10 position rank: 19th)Most weeks you‚Äôre happy to start the 49ers running back who is getting the lion‚Äôs share of the touches in the backfield. Last week it was McKinnon who held that job, and he performed okay thanks to finding the end zone. But that game was against the Packers, who allow the second-most fantasy points to running backs. Now, McKinnon will go up against one of the toughest defenses against fantasy running backs in the Saints. That, combined with a timeshare role, makes this a very unattractive start for him this week.Josh Reynolds (Rams) vs. Seattle Seahawks (Week 10 position rank: 58th)If you are scrambling for a player to plug into your flex, then you‚Äôve come to the right place as we dig deep for this one. Cooper Kupp and Robert Woods owners are salivating at the mouth as they get to attack that fantasy-friendly Seahawks defense, but what if we told you that there is plenty of love to go around. Gabriel Davis of the Bills (who is that?) put together a 15-point performance last week, making it the fifth time this season that three wide receivers from the same team have produced double-digit fantasy performances against the Seahawks this season. When you consider that Reynolds already has a role regular in the Rams offense and that he‚Äôs coming off two straight games with at least eight targets, the opportunity is there for this deep sleeper pick to have a nice game this week.Mike Evans (Bucs) vs. Carolina Panthers (Week 10 position rank: 24th)This suggestion is a little weird because Evans owners aren‚Äôt going to be sitting a talented receiver in a contest with the potential for a game script with a lot of points. We understand that. However, it should be noted that there are a few things going on here that could lead to an underwhelming performance by a Bucs receivers. For starters, there are a lot of mouths to feed with not only Evans, Chris Godwin, and Rob Gronkowski, but now Antonio Brown is in the mix. If last week was any indication, Brown‚Äôs going to be cutting into those targets. And when you consider that teams have a lot of success on the ground against the Panthers, the well is going to run dry for someone in that receiving group.Eric Ebron (Steelers) vs. Cincinnati Bengals (Week 10 position rank: 9th)The veteran wide receiver continues to get looks as he‚Äôs gotten at least five targets in six of the Steelers last seven games. Ebron has finished inside the top 10 for fantasy tight ends in two consecutive weeks. Of course, a big reason for that is that he‚Äôs caught a touchdown in both of those games. Like most tight ends in the league, Ebron is touchdown dependent, but that‚Äôs okay as he‚Äôll face a Bengals defense that has surrendered five touchdowns to tight ends over their last three games. Cincy gives up the most fantasy points to opposing tight ends, making Ebron a solid play this week.Jared Cook (Saints) vs. San Francisco 49ers (Week 10 position rank: 11th)Cook has been a solid fantasy performer thanks to a Saints offense that is fourth in the league in points scored. Over his last four games, three times he‚Äôs finished in the top six for fantasy tight ends. But in each of those games he was fortunate enough to find the end zone. This week, he‚Äôll face a stingy 49ers defense who doesn‚Äôt give up many fantasy points to opposing tight ends. And when you factor in that Michael Thomas is back and should demand a good share of targets, Cook could be in for a quiet afternoon.New York Giants vs. Philadelphia Eagles (Week 10 position rank: 10th)Last week we suggested starting the Giants defense against Washington and they finished as the fourth-best fantasy defense for the week. That dreadful NFC East is the gift that keeps on giving.So, it shouldn‚Äôt be that much of a surprise to see that we‚Äôre going to double-down with the Giants again as they go up against the Eagles. In fact, the Eagles are slightly more generous than Washington, so the stage is set for another quality outing by the Giants.Miami Dolphins vs. Los Angeles Chargers (Week 10 position rank: 12th)The Dolphins have a good defense, and they have finished in the top seven for the week in four straight games. This week, they‚Äôll face a Chargers team that has been fairly good on offense in recent games. Despite their inability to close the deal at the end of games, the offense can put up points. Thanks to a productive rookie quarterback in Justin Herbert, the Chargers have scored at least 26 points in five straight games. The Dolphins defense will make plays, but this one could be a lot more high-scoring than some expect."

Trust issues2. Dysfunctional environment3. SelfishnessAs Coach Meyer specified, ""The players don't trust the coach, the coach doesn't trust the players, or the players don't trust each other.""On October 20th, 2020, Jane Slater reported that one player told her that the coaching staff is, ""Totally unprepared,"" and that, ""They don't teach. They don't have any sense of adjusting on the fly."" Another player revealed that, ""they just aren't good at their jobs.""Of course, the cornerstone player that is Jaylon Smith retorted:Jaylon Smith on players reportedly criticizing coaches: ""(Mike McCarthy) is a players coach. If you got something to say, own up to it. Coach wants us to be grown men. It‚Äôs a blessing to have him as a coach. We have to perform...If you got something to say, put your name on it.""There certainly appears to be all three types of mistrust, as described by Meyer. In a sport where 11 athletes need to coordinate their efforts to maximize the outcome of each play, whether on defense or offense, this team appears to field 11 individuals working independently of each other. There is a degree of selfishness that is noticed in the play of Cowboys players.""In my opinion,'' said Danny White, ""they've got too many 'me-first' players and not enough 'team-first' players.'' Danny White continued, ""[The cuts Dallas executed a few weeks ago] should have been made probably weeks ago to get those guys that are me-first players out of the locker room. Because that becomes a cancer. ... The really good players were being affected by the 'me-first' players.''A dysfunctional work environment is characterized by the team having high expectations while not exhibiting the work ethic necessary to accomplish those lofty goals. As Meyers notes, ""frustration, anger, and disappointment quickly follow when work ethic does not exceed or equate to the expectations.""Last year, Dallas selected Trysten Hill, a rookie that had a reputation for being lazy. As per the Orlando Sentinel, Hill, ""started to gain a reputation, deserving or not, for being lazy and having attitude issues"" during his sophomore season in 2017. Taco Charlton was released because he did not possess the relentless drive the Cowboys required from their defensive players. His effort was described as too sporadic. According to Albert Breer, even the cornerstone player has his detractors:""A well-established fact within the walls of the Cowboys' facility: LB Jaylon Smith hasn't played up to his contract over the last year and a half. In fact, I know people there have been alarmed how often he's at the heart of big plays made against the Dallas defense. I believe he's got a pretty important couple months ahead, and it wouldn't shock me if he's gone after the year, regardless of who's running the defense.""Maybe that is why the 2020 Dallas Cowboys were favored to win the NFC East and progress in the playoffs, but instead are eyeing a top three draft choice for 2021. Of course, the decisions that led to the trifecta of reasons that are dooming the Cowboys can be traced to Jerry Jones. As long as he insists on acting as the GM, the culture at the Star is unlikely to change. Bill Parcells and Jimmy Johnson built the best versions of this team under Jerry, and neither of those coaches listened to the GM when making personnel decisions or permitted the owner to dictate the culture.Another user-created commentary provided by a BTB reader."

Even the squad‚Äôs wins were questionably earned, and had it not been for miraculous kismet vs. New York, and the ultimate brain-fart of brain-farts on Atlanta‚Äôs part in a comical onside kick attempt, their win total would be a goose egg.If you've read a midseason recap on Dallas‚Äô escapades up to this point, it‚Äôs likely been rife with lambasts on their porous performance. And I can easily admit that I‚Äôve been a fervent advocate of the same sentiment. They‚Äôve been terrible. But while there‚Äôs much to talk about in terms of pessimism, this year hasn‚Äôt been completely fraught with negatives. There have been some bright spots, and although they‚Äôve been rare as a two-dollar bill, to gloss over them would be an injustice to the good that has taken place.It‚Äôs a semi-occurrent happenstance, but for my own morale‚Äôs sake (and for that of Cowboys Nation as a whole) it‚Äôs worthy of focus.Here are the top three showings from the ‚ÄòBoys thus far.This was probably the most evenly-contested matchup Dallas partook in all season. And ironically, one of the ‚ÄòBoys best outings came with the least amount of preconditioning under their belts.The team who stopped Dallas‚Äô 2018 Super Bowl bid short was first up on their 2020 schedule, and the matchup lived up to its massive Sunday Night billing. There were stars to be recognized on both sides: Prescott, Elliott, Cooper. Donald, Ramsey, Woods.And Mike McCarthy would get a revealing first-game test against play-calling guru Sean McVay. While he didn't quite pass, his initial offering was not foretelling of anything close to the crumple we would witness soon thereafter. His offense accounted for 380 collective yards and 24 first downs, while posting their most efficient 60-minute slate yet, surrendering no turnovers to the opposition.Dak Prescott was serviceably comfortable in the pocket, dispersing accurate passes like free handouts to a variety of his most reliable targets. Dallas surrendered an early 7-0 lead, but regained their footing in the second on a vintage Elliott rumble out of the backfield. Elliott would finish with 96 yards on 22 carries, while raking in three big receptions, including the touchdown.Meanwhile the defense held its own, and although they were a step slow both on-field and strategic-wise, they got momentous contributions from several key components, and forced one of their lone takeaways on the year with a Chidobe Awuzie interception as well.The game remained a back-and-forth slobberknocker until its final minutes, and the ‚ÄòBoys secondary came up with a huge stop on a 3rd-and-3 to return the pigskin to their quarterback with just over two minutes remaining.Then came the controversy.Prescott willed his team forward on a few dump routes, before the dwindling clock beckoned a deep shot from #4. He acquiesced, and found Michael Gallup downfield in a one-on-one matchup with Jalen Ramsey, who jolted past his defender and reeled in a 40+ yard reception.Except there was a flag. Which, thrown with under 20 seconds left rendered their chances for comeback dead and moot. It‚Äôs tough to see games decided by officials, especially when it‚Äôs your team that‚Äôs on the wrong end of a loss. And it was a devastating one when taking all circumstances into account.My unbiased opinion as a Michael Gallup fantasy owner is that this was not an offensive pass interference. pic.twitter.com/LETU7WLBObBut ludicrously enough, it became one of Dallas‚Äô superior performances on the year.This was the outing in which everything collectively hit the fan.The fact that it‚Äôs one of Dallas‚Äô best three performances is a testament to how poorly the troupe has played all year. But it was the poise and harmonious demeanor with which Dallas responded in lieu of Dak Prescott‚Äôs trip-up that vaults this game into the #2 slot.Unlike their usual status quo, the Cowboys actually jumped out to an early lead in the game, and writ their trademark all over its opening moments as the Giants D faltered in containment efforts. The ‚ÄòBoys defense, though, showcased more of the same ineptitude that has plummeted them to a bottom spot in league rankings.Daniel Jones looked like Fran Tarkenton on the pitch, and the Giants QB ducked, dodged and scrambled circles around Dallas‚Äô brigade, easily coasting back downfield for an emphatic touchdown in response.Then the Giants defense woke up out of their slumber.On the following possession, Kyler Fackrell picked off Prescott and found paydirt following an Elliott botched catch attempt, before another stop allowed NY to kick a field goal to increase their lead to 17-3.This marked the emergence of Prescott-time.Prescott willed his team back downfield like a calculative chess master-like returning drive, garnering enough field position for Elliott to smoothly slide into the end zone for his first TD. Dallas would force a turnover on New York‚Äôs ensuing try - a crunching DeMarcus Lawrence sack dislodged Jones of the football, which found Anthony Brown with ready mitts and nothing but daylight in front of him as he raced back towards the Giant lead, knotting the table at 17.This is #Cowboys DE @TankLawrence's 40th career sack, and CB Anthony Brown's first career touchdown.pic.twitter.com/zpo4dZDwEtBig Blue would retort with a FG of their own, before #4 flashed his armor again - this time piercing the Giants secondary with a surprise TD reception on a throwback from Cedric Wilson.It would be one of the last times he would have the luxury to do so.The G-men added another three-ball as the second half got underway, and Prescott - as he‚Äôs done time and time again - began guiding his squadron towards fort NY. He‚Äôs a fearless captain that has no problem sinking with the ship, and unfortunately, that fervor became his imminent downfall.There is no need to fully detail what happened next. It stings most of Cowboys Nation with as great a force as any injury has in the team‚Äôs storied history, and Dak‚Äôs broken ankle with just over six minutes remaining in the third quarter swiftly dashed hopes of success on the season - let alone a win in the game.Well don‚Äôt tell Andy Dalton that. Dallas scored on that same possession after a Dalton-Lamb connection granted them adequate territory for an Elliott scamper. Elliott flashed a resounding #4 to the camera as he joined his teammates in celebration, and if his team‚Äôs message hadn‚Äôt clear been up to that point, he made sure that it was fully felt: we‚Äôre going to win for Dak.4's up for @dak ‚úä@EzekielElliott | #DallasCowboys pic.twitter.com/9NAvzBI57IThey didn‚Äôt fail their fallen soldier.The D was able to thwart off Jones and company‚Äôs next attempt for salvage, and while they surrendered a late score to Devonta Freeman, they unanimously rose to the game‚Äôs largest occasion - forcing a punt with close to a minute left and a 34-34 tie.Dalton would proceed to create a career-type moment for himself, dropping off three pivotal passes in succession - the last of which found a streaking Michael Gallup on the receiving end just inside the 20-yard line.Greg Zuerlein took care of the rest, depositing a painless game-winner as time expired to seal the victory - one that was unequivocally earned in honor of #4.The total over-under for points this game was more likely to eclipse 43.5 than it was to tunnel the number. And this had nothing to do with Dallas. The undefeated Pittsburgh Steelers were projected to completely blow the Cowboys out of the water last Sunday.Dallas had been reduced to their fourth QB of the season, while Big Ben has been Pro Bowl-worthy in his return from the injury shelf. And don‚Äôt even get me started on Pittsburgh‚Äôs bullish defense. Every viable piece of evidence one could use pitted the Cowboys in a dangerous line of fire as the ‚ÄòBurgh eagerly awaited kill-shot allowance upon arrival at AT&T stadium.They‚Äôve been most experts‚Äô #1 seeded defense since the season‚Äôs inception, coexisting as a consolidated wrecking crew led by the likes of T.J. Watt, Bud Dupree and Minkah Fitzpatrick. But little did we know - Dallas‚Äô barricade had a few tricks up their own sleeve.They diffused Ben Roethlisberger and the ‚ÄòBurgh offense to near Sahara-like dryness as the matchup got underway, while rendering the Steelers quadruplet behemoth of Juju Smith-Schuster, Chase Claypool, Diontae Johnson and James Washington nearly impotent.Meanwhile, next man up Garrett Gilbert looked smooth and effortless in the pocket. He was confident from the opening snap, and fired off a beautiful pass on his initial attempt - a rainbow floater for Amari Cooper, who sped his way past midfield. They would have to settle for a field goal though after Pittsburgh bounced back to quell their momentum.Dallas snatched it right back after a huge fourth-down stop on a risky Steelers‚Äô gamble, and Gilbert broke off two first-down rushes before following up a dime throw to Dalton Schultz with an even better one to CeeDee Lamb for six.Pittsburgh found themselves unable to gain traction again, and things went from bad to worse for the black and yellow on a sly trick call from John Fassel on the ensuing punt. The play: a cunning throwback design that misguided the defense to one side of the field, while a (supposedly) hobbled C.J. Goodwin masqueraded down the other - an intriguingly perfect deceit. The big breakdown allowed Goodwin to scoot to the 10-yard line, but the ‚ÄòBoys found themselves unable to capitalize, settling for another FG.Pittsburgh began to transform into their old selves near the end of the second half as Big Ben added another touchdown pass to his tremendous total. As did Dallas - CeeDee Lamb fumbled near his own end zone to allow the Steelers an extra three. Still, though, Dallas reached halftime with a lead - a sentiment that prior to the game would‚Äôve incited hysterical laughter.The ‚ÄòBoys added two more Greg Zuerlein kicks to increase their advantage to 10, while the defense continued their surprise dominance by holding Pittsburgh scoreless in the third quarter.But what‚Äôs this 2020 season without a Cowboys fold? The two are one and the same, and the floodgates opened in the fourth.Pittsburgh got a timely touchdown from James Washington, and Garrett Gilbert followed that with an interception of his own. The Steelers got a FG from the blunder, as well as the ball with just over three minutes left - which was a welcome treat for the seasoned Roethlisberger. He spearheaded his team to another game-winning drive, effectively keeping their spotless record intact along the way.Still, though, Dallas was a worthy contender. They put up a 364 yard total - their highest since Prescott went down, and relinquished their lowest rushing number on the campaign in addition (64).And they almost won. It will be counted as a loss nonetheless, but in a season with this much turmoil, it can‚Äôt possibly be deemed a horrid one. There were several flashes of competence, and even dominance. Flashes that, while short-lived, will still be preserved as long as possible while we eagerly await a change in tide."
753,raiders,https://www.silverandblackpride.com/2020/11/16/21569817/week-10-grades#comments,Week 10 grades,"Silver And Black Pride, a Las Vegas Raiders communityBy RaiderCode on Nov 16, 2020, 10:06am PST +This was a must-win game if the Raiders wanted to keep pace in the playoff hunt. Even at 6-3 there are 8 other AFC teams with that record or better. With yesterday's win, the Raiders sit at the 6th seed. Tentative, especially with KC coming to town off their bye next week.But they got the win they had to have. The 37-12 'blowout' score doesn't tell the whole story. After a nice opening stop on D and then a TD scoring drive to go up 7-0 early, the Raiders were playing like crap the rest of the first half. Sputtering on offense, they went 3 and out three straight times. Even after a Jeff Health interception on an overthrow, they could go nowhere. And the Raiders defense was atrocious, they missed tackle after tackle. And gave up third down after third down. The only reason Denver didn't score more was really their own mistakes, penalties and turnovers. Raiders somehow held a small 10-6 lead with Denver driving, but Heath jumped in front of a Drew Lock pass in the endzone that kept the score there but things still looked shaky.In the 2nd half, the Raiders were only up 13-6 until the final 40 seconds of the third quarter when Jacobs scored his 2nd TD to make it a more comfortable 20-6 lead. After that the game got out of hand, the Raiders picked off Lock 2 more times and recovered a fumble for a total of 5 turnovers on the day and scored 17 more points in a runaway finish. Similar to how they lost the Bucs game.We'll take any win however we get it, but Gruden was clear after the presser that there is so much to clean up. The defense got turnovers and that covers up alot of their poor play. The offense got 5 more possessions than they normally would get. They were able to keep pounding the ball, tiring out the Donkey D and holding possession for almost 15 more minutes. Let's be happy, but the offense left at least 3 more TD's on the field and the defense was being beaten as they normally do, terrible tackling, out of position and giving up 3rd down's all over the place.OffenseQB : Grade C
C is an average grade and I think Carr had an average game for him. Didn't make any mistakes but only 154 yards and no TD's. Had 3 drops that weren't his fault that could have each scored.RB : Grade A
Jacobs was a beast yet again, over 100 yards, 2TDs and 4+ ypc. He's just getting better as the season progresses. Booker had another big day with 2 TD's against his old team. To be fair, this was a matter of attrition. The Raiders kept running it up the middle over and over, many times for little or no yards. Sometimes frustratingly so. But after getting so many additional possessions, the dam finally broke in the 4th quarter and the backs had a field day against a depleted defense. Richard took a huge pop to the chest and might miss some time. Time to see what Theo Riddick can do next week. Ingold played with rib pads (and a pain killing shot for sure).OL: Grade A
Have to give it to them once again. No sacks and over 200 yards rushing. All this with 3 starters out. Sam Young couldn't finish again, Patrick Omameh came in and they reshuffled the OL. And they were still able to run it. Amazing. Tom Cable needs to get Asst Coach of the Year honors.WR : Grade D
Ruggs dropped a perfect pass that should have scored. That's not good. Agholor dropped one in the endzone. That's not good. Renfrow had a nice catch and run for a big play and Edwards caught one for a first down. That was it. Again, it was a day for running the ball, but come on guys. Any other day, that would have cost us the game.TE : Grade D
Waller dropped a perfect pass - should have been a TD, or at least 1st and goal. Again, on another day that costs us the game. He only had 3 other catches on the day and no scores. Nothing from Witten or Moreau. The blocking was OK I suppose but most of the action was up the middle.DefenseDL : Grade C
It was good in some ways. Crosby got another sack, Nassib got a pick in coverage. But the tackling was atrocious at times, Melvin Gordon was eating them alive early. Arden Key's big shot on Lock changed the game though as it hurt his ribs and he couldn't throw accurately after that. Once they got the big lead it should have been feast time. We saw Irving play a few snaps. Cle had only one tackle on the day.LB : Grade B
Morrow had a big day. Gruden said it's the best he's played as a Raider. He had 5 tackles and a sack on a blitz. Kwaitkowski was very solid, he had 8 tackles and a highlight one-handed, sky grab pick late that sealed the game. But they both missed way too many tackles IMO. Raekwon McMillan played 9 snaps and had zero stats. We gave away a 4th round pick for this guy?? Ugh....CB : Grade C
They gave up 16 catches to WR's on the day. Mullen had 7 tackles and made some plays, but he was getting targeted early and gave up some. Lawson appears to be regressing with each game, he had 1 tackle on the day. Joyner had his standard, some nice plays, but not so nice coverage at times. Arnette played 45 snaps, which is alot considering he has been out for over a month, but logged zero stats.S : Grade B
Jeff Heath was a ballhawk with 2 huge interceptions both really changed the game. Abrams was a heat seeking missle but got a 15 yard personal foul on a shot he should not have taken. He keeps that up and he's going to be red flagged. Harris had a decent day with 5 tackles and a couple pass breakups. It could be better but the INTs bring the grade up.Special Teams : Grade B
Great punting by Cole. Another solid day for Carlson 3-3 and a 52 yarder. But a beautiful punt return for TD by Renfrow called back on an Abrams stupid hold keeps it from being an A. We're getting better each week on this side of the ball.Overall : Grade B
You would think with a final score like that they would deserve an A, but really this game should have been 54-12 or better. The Broncos played terrible. 5 turnovers is a disaster for any team and the penalties bailed us out many times. The offense left a ton of opportunities out there, especially those 3 bad drops that would have scored. And a bad holding negated a punt return TD. Tackling and 3rd down is still a HUGE problem that they have to figure out ASAP.But getting this win is big. It keeps us in the very competitive playoff hunt. If we lose to KC this week (which is a high probability), we'll be sitting at 6-4, just like last season. And just like last season, we'll have an 'easy games schedule' that aren't going to be so easy. The hope is we can get the OL back healthy for a stretch run and keep being able to control the clock and keep the very porous defense off the field.VOTE view results"

Late in the first half, Broncos quarterback Drew Lock ran in for a touchdown to give Denver the lead but it was called back on a penalty. On the next play, Lock threw an interception to Raiders‚Äô safety Jeff Heath. It was Heath‚Äôs second pick of the first half and the Raiders went into halftime leading 10-6. Huge.Big second half:
The Raiders put away the game on both sides of the ball in the second half. Josh Jacobs scored his second touchdowns of the game and defensively, the Raiders forced Lock into throwing his third and fourth interceptions. The Raiders also recovered a fumble in the fourth quarter. It was a complete team win.Tempers flare:
Raiders cornerback Isaiah Johnson and Broncos receiver Tim Patrick were both ejected from the game for throwing punches in a fight that involved safety Johnathan Abram.Great start:
After holding the Broncos to a three-and-out on the first drive of the game, the Raiders went down the field, scoring on an 11-yard Josh Jacobs run. It was fueled by a 25-yard catch-and-run on third down by Hunter Renfrow. Weapons ... the Raiders have plenty.Linebacker look:
Nicholas Morrow (who had a big game) and Raekwon McMillan played with Nick Kwiatkoski in the Raiders‚Äô 4-3 base defense with Cory Littleton on the reserve/COVID-19 list.Bummer:
Hunter Renfrow had a beautiful 60-yard punt return for a touchdown in the second quarter, but Abram was called for a blindside block to negate the play.Missed big play:
Raiders‚Äô rookie receiver Henry Ruggs III left a big play slip away when the ball went through his hands in the first quarter.Key making plays:
Backup defensive end Arden Key made a few solid plays in the first half. Yes, that is noteworthy.Jeudy shows up:
Ruggs‚Äô Alabama teammate, Jerry Jeudy, who was taken three picks after the Raiders took Ruggs, had a 26-yard catch from Drew Lock on third down and 15 in the second quarter. It set up a field goal to cut the Raiders‚Äô lead to 7-6."

For many of you, your fantasy football playoffs will be starting in the next few weeks. We gotta get as many wins as we can over these next few weeks. If you have any Raiders players and are questioning whether or not you should start them, hopefully this will help!As always, start Darren Waller. He‚Äôs one of the best tight ends in football, and arguably one of the best in regards to fantasy football. He‚Äôs Derek Carr‚Äôs No. 1 option in the passing game, so his volume will always be there. This is a no brainer. Just enjoy the fact you‚Äôre lucky enough to have him on your team!Josh Jacobs is another one of those guys you start on a week-to-week basis, no matter what. He hasn‚Äôt lived up to expectations so far in fantasy this season, but he has some of the best upside when it comes to running backs. We‚Äôve seen it before, but he‚Äôs a guy who can find the endzone multiple times.Derek Carr (Start)Derek Carr continues to impress this season, so roll him out there this weekend. Depending on the QB‚Äôs available, there may be some other QB‚Äôs I‚Äôd rather start, but I think Carr is a really good option this week against the Broncos.I learned the hard way last week that Henry Ruggs should likely not be on your fantasy roster. I dropped him this week and didn‚Äôt even think twice. Sure, he could turn out to be a stud in the years to come, but fantasy wise he‚Äôs been a bust. Please don‚Äôt start him. Only start him if you‚Äôre projected to win by 50 and you wanna take a chance of him having three long touchdowns so you can beat your opponent by 100.After being on the ‚Äúsit‚Äù train all season with Nelson Agholor, I think you can officially start him on a week-to-week basis. Of course, this is dependent on the size of your league and your rosters, but he‚Äôs a go. I‚Äôve been banking on Ruggs being the deep option for Carr, but it‚Äôs clearly Agholor, as he‚Äôs been reeling in touchdowns like crazy. He had another big one last week, and he has the upside to win you your week. If you don‚Äôt have any better options, I really like him as a FLEX play.If he‚Äôs your last resort, that‚Äôs fine. But try and avoid playing Hunter Renfrow."

It's one thing to lose, quite another to be disrespectedMonday, Gruden said the Raiders took the ride because a ‚Äúsmart aleck‚Äù bus driver made some snide comments. He called the situation ‚Äúridiculous.‚ÄùMy thoughts on the situation remain the same as when the story first broke: Who cares???The Raiders celebrated the way they wanted to after a huge win and the Chiefs are clearly not happy about it.

McKinley will be on the NFL waiver wire by Wednesday.We've made the following roster moves: Waived DE Takk McKinley (failed physical) & released OT O‚ÄôShea Dugas from the practice squad.Last Wednesday, the Bengals were awarded him off of waivers from Atlanta Falcons. The Raiders were one of four teams to put in a waiver claim. The San Francisco 49ers and the Cleveland Browns also put in claims for him.The Bengals were awarded the 2017 first-round pick because NFL waivers is based off records and the Bengals had the worst record of the four claiming teams.RELATEDIf the 49ers, Browns and Raiders all claim McKinley again this week, the 49ers will get him. The Raiders have the lowest priority of the remaining teams.It was not disclosed why McKinley failed his physical, but if the Raiders feel like the reason is minor, it will be worth putting in another claim.McKinley is 25, he has 17.5 career sacks and his contract for the rest of the season is affordable at less than $1 million. The Raiders could use more pass-rush help, so the interest still may be there.Stay tuned ...UPDATE: The 49ers plan on claiming McKinley, so there you go.#49ers to put in another waiver claim on DE Tak McKinley, who failed his physical with Bengals upon getting claimed off Falcons waivers"

Raiders‚Äô second-year running back Josh Jacobs is out of his mini slump. He ran for 112 yards and had two touchdowns runs on 21 carries and averaged 5.3 yards a carry, which is important since he was averaging 3.4 yards a carry for the season a couple of weeks ago. He has 315 rushing yards during the Raiders‚Äô three-game winning streak. DeVontae Booker pitched in with 81 yards on 16 carries and two touchdowns against his former team. If the Raiders keep this ground dominance up, they will be a tough January opponent.Defense makes a difference:
The Raiders picked off Denver quarterback Drew Lock four times and had a fumble recovery. Lock and the Broncos were bad, but the Raiders‚Äô stepped up on defense. Several players ‚Äî including safety Jeff Heath, linebacker Nicholas Morrow and defensive linemen Maliek Collins and Arden Key ‚Äî had solid games.Can‚Äôt praise offensive line enough:
The Raiders have played three snaps this season with their starting five offensive linemen, but it hasn‚Äôt mattered. They keep getting hurt and they keep playing great football. It‚Äôs pretty special.Third quarter dominance:
This game changed at the end of the first half when Lock had a touchdown run called back by a penalty and then threw an interception on the next play as the Raiders kept a 10-6 lead. Then the Raiders came out in the third quarter and steamrolled Denver on both sides of the ball, turning a tight game into a blowout. The Raiders have been much better in the third quarter this season than last year and it was on display again Sunday.No looking ahead:
This could have been a trap game with next week‚Äôs monster matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs looming. But the Raiders kept their focus and took care of business against the Broncos, improving to 6-3 and solidifying themselves in the AFC playoff race. Good for them.Now, it‚Äôs Chiefs Week. Let‚Äôs go."

When he signed in the spring as a free agent, it did not move the radar much and the former Denver Broncos‚Äô running back was considered far from a lock to make the roster.However, halfway through the season, Booker has been a dynamic backup option for star running back Josh Jacobs. Booker was huge in the Raiders‚Äô win over the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Chargers and he has is averaging 6.8 yards a carry on 33 rush attempts and he has eight catches out of the backfield.Booker was drafted by the Broncos in 2016 and he had 612 rushing yards as a rookie, but his playing time dwindled each year. Denver coach Vic Fangio said he was impressed to see Booker do well in this new opportunity this week."

He had two tackles ‚Äî but his impact was bigger than that ‚Äîand he was as active as he‚Äôs ever been since being drafted in the third round in 2018.Key will likely always be a rotational player, but if he can give the same energy off the bench moving forward this season, it will help the Raiders‚Äô defense.Raiders coach Jon Gruden was complimentary of Key‚Äôs play in the game.‚ÄúHe made some good plays,‚Äù Gruden said. ‚ÄúHe got home a couple times, he showed great energy and pursuit, and really had fun playing. He‚Äôs been out a couple weeks. You know, Rod Marinelli, our new defensive line coach thinks a lot of Arden Key. He‚Äôs been one of his I think most impressive guys on the practice field. It was good to see it come out on game day yesterday. We need him on Sunday for sure.‚ÄùKey, who had just three sacks in 30 NFL games, may never be a consistent impact player, but Sunday‚Äôs performance showed the Raiders can still salvage his career."

The unit played well in two of the three wins. With a huge Week 11 home game against the Kansas City Chiefs coming up on Sunday night, Gruden likes what he is seeing.The Raiders had five turnovers, doubling their season total, in a Week 10 37-12 win over the Denver Broncos. Much of the changes on defense have been scheme wise, doing things such as blitz changes.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to get into the specific tweaks that we‚Äôve made, but we have changed the style in which we play to a degree,‚Äù Gruden said. ‚ÄúI think guys are playing with confidence. I think they‚Äôre playing with a lot less indecision. They‚Äôre playing down-to-down with better communication and I think it‚Äôs growing as we speak.‚ÄùThe Raiders‚Äô defense played well in the second half of a 40-32 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 5 and it allowed just eight points in the second half and had its best pass-rush burst of the season. Gruden wants to see the same energy that the Las Vegas defense has been showing lately for the entire 60 minutes against Kansas City.‚ÄúI thought we played with great energy and passion,‚Äù Gruden said of the effort against Denver. ‚ÄúThat was kind of the word we harped on before the game ‚Äì go out there and cut it loose, play our hearts out and let‚Äôs feed off each other‚Äôs energy.‚Äù"

All the talk this week has been around Denver QB Drew Lock and his prowess indoors during his young career ‚Äî so we wanted to hear it from the locals about whether or not that could continue this week.Thanks fo Joe Rowles from Mile High Report for taking the time to answer our questions:S&BP: How is the health of this Broncos team, and is there any one position affected greater by injuries ahead of this one?MHR: It‚Äôs a mess. They went without three of their four best cornerbacks last week. (LB) Von Miller and (WR) Courtland Sutton have played in all of one game this season. As for this week, there‚Äôs a possibility the Broncos may be down to their fifth-string right tackle Sunday.S&BP: We‚Äôve seen the reports, we‚Äôve seen the stats, Drew Lock apparently dominates indoors. Is this something, in your opinion, that is likely to continue this weekend?MHR: Lock has struggled for the better part of this season. Across the board all of his passing stats are down. He‚Äôs drinking from a firehose in the Pat Shurmur offense and trying to grasp all the complexities of reading an NFL defense while trying to refine his mechanics.The last two weeks Lock has gotten hot late in by settling in and trusting his protection. He has the weapons to put up big numbers and there are guys getting open. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if Tim Patrick and Jerry Jeudy find a way to make some noise in the roomba.S&BP: Finish the sentence: The Broncos will win this game unless ___.MHR: Drew Lock starts seeing ghosts and bailing out of clean pockets.S&BP: Who is one player on each side of the ball that Raiders fans should know about, or will know about, once this game is over?MHR: He‚Äôs probably a familiar name, but Tim Patrick is going to be the big one. For most of this season, he‚Äôs been Lock‚Äôs favorite target. When Sutton went down for the year, he took over the X-receiver role in Shurmur‚Äôs offense and has had some really nice moments. Last week, a couple 50-50 balls didn‚Äôt go his way, but he wins above the rim and has sneaky speed for a 6‚Äô4‚Äù receiver.I‚Äôd imagine Justin Simmons is a household name, so I‚Äôll say on defense keep an eye out for Josey Jewell. He‚Äôs a big X-factor this week since Shelby Harris will miss the game. He has some athletic limitations, but has played far better than I dared hope.S&BP: Prediction time: Who wins, what‚Äôs the final score?MHR: It‚Äôs going to come down to the Broncos offense. I have no doubt Gruden will find ways to score some points. If Shurmur can find ways to keep his quarterback on track, Phillip Lindsay will score a big score that winds up the difference. 28-24."

Preston Williams of the Miami Dolphins.Williams had 32 catches on 60 targets for 428 yards, second-most among rookies behind the 458 by Terry McLaurin of the Washington Wedontcallthemthatanymores. DK Metcalf of the Seattle Seahawks was third at 402 yards.Through their team‚Äôs first eight games this season, Metcalf and McLaurin continue to dominate and they‚Äôve taken their successes to another level with another year of experience: Metcalf has 788 yards and eight touchdowns through eight games, McLaurin has 692 and a class-leading 50 receptions despite playing with Dwayne Haskins, Kyle Allen and Alex Smith, who at one point seemed less likely to make a comeback than the tight end Alex Smith who retired in 2015.There are some other receivers in the 2019 class who‚Äôve had varying levels of success in both seasons so far, of course.A.J. Brown of the Titans; Darius Slayton of the Giants; Marquise Brown of the Ravens; Mecole Hardman of the Chiefs; Diontae Johnson of the Steelers; Deebo Samuel of the 49ers; and of course, Hunter Renfrow. Williams went on injured reserve after eight games last season and that happened again in 2020, though he could return from his foot sprain.There have been a couple of examples of receivers having success in year two after not doing so as rookies, including Scotty Miller of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Travis Fulgham of the Philadelphia Eagles. And then there are the potential regrets.Not just that N‚ÄôKeal Harry of the Patriots, JJ Arcega-Whiteside of the Eagles, Parris Campbell of the Colts and Andy Isabella of the Cardinals might have been poor choices in the first and second rounds, but the mounds of regret that teams like the Ravens might have for choosing Hollywood Brown ‚Äî a decent player thus far ‚Äî over the likes of Brown, Metcalf and McLaurin. Or the Patriots being stuck with Harry instead of those players. The Eagles taking JJAW over DKM and TMcL.And maybe one day we‚Äôll be talking about how every team passed on Slayton, Fulgham, Miller and Renfrow.The good news about a loaded receiver class ‚Äî especially ones that come in back-to-back years ‚Äî is that you have greater odds of finding a hit. The bad news is that a moderate hit like Brown is still only a double compared to the home runs found on day two. And in the heavy passing, high-scoring world of 2020 football, ‚Äòships dig the long ball.The 2020 wide receiver class was meant to be even better than the one in 2019. While last year‚Äôs crop was plenty deep and overloaded with exciting options on day two, this year‚Äôs group had three players being bandied about as top-10 picks if the draft wasn‚Äôt also top-heavy at quarterback, tackle and cornerback. The Las Vegas Raiders were on the clock after 11 players were selected and none of the choices was a wide receiver.General manager Mike Mayock could select a wide receiver, as most expected the Raiders to do, or he could go outside of expectations and pick the best player available knowing that five, 10 or even 15 more interesting receivers could be left on the board when Las Vegas was back on the clock at 19. Mayock could even trade back (theoretically) and find ways to stockpile additional choices when the Raiders were without their next pick until 80 and 81 ... both of which were used on ‚Äúwide receivers.‚ÄùJon Gruden says it was a ‚Äútough call‚Äù to draft Henry Ruggs over Jerry Jeudy.

‚ÄúWe liked Jeudy a lot‚ÄùWell, one wide receiver, one Miami Dolphins running back.The decision to select Henry Ruggs III over either of those choices, as well as instead of Jerry Jeudy and CeeDee Lamb, was not an odd one. It was not a controversial one either. Some people preferred Jeudy. Some people preferred Lamb. Some people preferred Ruggs.The Broncos liked Henry Ruggs ‚Äúa lot‚Äù in the draft process, according to Fangio.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very, very fast‚ÄùPerhaps there was some risk with Ruggs because he wasn‚Äôt the highly productive number one option at Alabama like Jeudy was at the same school or like Lamb was at Oklahoma, but every draft pick carries different risks. Jeudy and Lamb will never have the physical attributes that Ruggs does and that may yet prove to matter.It just hasn‚Äôt proven to matter yet.If Mayock has screwed up anywhere in the 2020 draft ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not saying that he has because it‚Äôs only been a half of one rookie season, which is why I wanted to start out by highlighting the midway point for the 2019 class ‚Äî it is not necessarily with the selection of Ruggs but the miscalculation of either where the receiver talent would be available in the draft or his own ability to find the sleepers.Between Denzel Mims at pick 59 and Gabe Davis at pick 128, the only wide receivers selected were Bryan Edwards by Mayock and Devin Duvernay, who went to Baltimore. Mayock also chose Lynn Bowden, Jr., but he was placed at running back and then he was placed on the trade block. Edwards had a fantastic training camp and was off to a fine start before foot and shoulder injuries pushed him off the field, returning last week to play one snap against the LA Chargers, but what other options existed to Mayock now that we‚Äôve seen a half-season from this rookie class?The most obvious ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù scenario has to involve tackle Tristan Wirfs. Just Blog Baby compared him to ‚Äúabsolute monster of a man‚Äù Trent Brown after his dominant combine performance. How great would it have been for the Raiders to have a Trent Brown clone who above all else is not Trent Brown? Wirfs was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers one pick after Las Vegas selected Ruggs and he‚Äôs been called a potential Pro Bowl player in his first NFL season.Making this choice of course means that the Raiders would still need to pick a receiver, something Mayock clearly wasn‚Äôt going to leave the draft without doing at least twice.Midway through 2020, Ruggs ranks 10th among rookie receivers in yards, having played in six of a possible eight games. He has 10 catches for 220 yards, displaying the same low-volume, high-yardage-per-catch output he had with the Crimson Tide.Gruden mentioned possibly working Henry Ruggs in some sideline drills this week & it‚Äôs a good idea. This one & the TD last week are two big plays he would have made if he got both feet in. It‚Äôs not uncommon for rookies to need to work on this once in the NFL. #RaiderNation pic.twitter.com/YBgpiApBZDComparatively, Jeudy has caught 30 passes for 484 yards with the Denver Broncos and Lamb has caught 44 passes for 595 yards with the Dallas Cowboys; unsurprisingly, Lamb has caught only eight of 17 passes for 98 yards in the last three games and is less productive without Dak Prescott as his quarterback. Lamb is not the most productive rookie though.That belongs to Justin Jefferson of the Vikings, who has caught 34 passes for 627 yards and ranks first in both DVOA and DYAR at FootballOutsiders. Not among rookies, but among all receivers. Jefferson went 22nd in the draft and would have been available at 19 if the Raiders had opted to go in another direction at pick 12. Or if they wanted to double down on receivers in the first round, since the selection of Edwards clearly indicates that the position was that important to Mayock and Jon Gruden.Justin Jefferson with a nasty double move: pic.twitter.com/5KdlujI9YtThose aren‚Äôt the only four rookie receivers of note either.Tee Higgins of the Bengals has 33 catches for 488 yards and he‚Äôs become more dominant over the last five games (413 yards in that stretch); Chase Claypool of the Steelers has 31 catches for 444 yards and seven total touchdowns; Brandon Aiyuk of the 49ers has 371 yards, including 206 in the last two weeks; Darnell Mooney of the Bears, Laviska Shenault of the Jaguars and Davis with the Bills have also all topped 275 yards thus far and have proven to be dependable, interesting prospects.Is Tee Higgins playing like a top 10 WR?

Since Week 4, the #Bengals rookie has earned a @PFF receiving grade of 83.4, while averaging 2.43 yards per route run. Both of those marks rank 10th among 104 WRs in that span.

Safe to say Higgins has impressed.
pic.twitter.com/j03dWsC6LzThe challenge for Mayock and Gruden won‚Äôt be to justify the Ruggs and Damon Arnette and Bryan Edwards picks based only on what they end up doing (the Bowden pick has already been called ‚Äúunjustified,‚Äù though maybe you don‚Äôt feel that way), but also based on what the other options they could have had end up doing relative to those players.Highest YAC per reception by WRs:
1. Deebo Samuel - 13.3
2. Henry Ruggs III - 10.0
3. Jalen Guyton - 9.8 pic.twitter.com/cgUQHMtFTNIt is also relative to where the Raiders‚Äô issues and roster holes will be popping up and their decision to pass on players like Wirfs.Since Ruggs returned from an injury in Week 5 to put up 118 yards (on two catches) in a win against the Chiefs, prompting Gruden to say ‚ÄúWell, yeah, we did not bring him in here to run hitch routes‚Äù and that Ruggs was a ‚Äúgreat route runner‚Äù who needed to get the ball more, he‚Äôs been targeted a total of 10 times, catching four passes for 43 yards and no touchdowns. He also has three carries for 21 yards. Las Vegas has scored an average of 22 points per game in that stretch but has managed to pull out a 2-1 record from those games.Ruggs caught zero of his three targets against the Chargers in Week 9.It was hard to find comparisons to Ruggs in the 2020 draft and it is hard to find comparisons for him in NFL history, which is what makes him the most exciting theoretical receiver prospect in the class (which continues to be true today), but the closest that people have mentioned is Tyreek Hill. The Chiefs did not extract much yardage value out of Hill over his first six career games, but it is worth comparing him to Ruggs, who is also one year younger than Hill was in 2016.Hill caught 14 of 17 targets for 125 yards over his first six games in the NFL. He was playing with Alex Smith (the quarterback, not the retired tight end) and only averaged 7.3 yards per target and 8.9 yards per catch. However, he also scored three touchdowns and was returning kickoffs and punts.Over the final 10 games of his rookie season, Hill caught 47 of 66 targets for 468 yards and carried the ball 19 times for 250 rushing yards, scoring a total of six touchdowns.Though I do not have Hill‚Äôs average depth of target from his rookie season, those numbers begin to show up on Pro-Football-Reference in 2018, I would be surprised if it comes close to the 19.8 ADOT that Ruggs has on his first 21 targets. Kansas City was putting the ball in Hill‚Äôs hands and Smith was rarely passing deep to Hill.According to P-F-R, Smith was 4 of 13 on deep passes to Hill and backup Nick Foles was 2 of 2. That‚Äôs 15 total deep passes to Hill over 16 games.Through six games together, Derek Carr is three of 10 on deep passes to Ruggs. That does mean that Carr has completed three deep passes for 163 yards and a touchdown. It also means that he‚Äôs missed seven deep passes to Ruggs.And by the way, six of Ruggs‚Äô 10 catches have gone for six or fewer yards. It‚Äôs been a battle of ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù with this particular pick as opposed to Las Vegas going for a wide receiver like Jeudy, Lamb, Jefferson, Higgins, Claypool or Aiyuk, who have been regularly targeted options already.The Raiders are on pace to be led in receiving by tight end Darren Waller (who has 50 catches for only 394 yards in eight games) and then Renfrow, who has 27 catches for 369 and two touchdowns. Nelson Agholor has 17 catches for 347 yards, giving Las Vegas the deep play threat that they assumed Ruggs needed to be; Carr is six of eight on deep passes to Agholor, including four touchdowns.It doesn‚Äôt quite make sense yet how Gruden is utilizing Ruggs; they‚Äôre using him like a veteran Tyreek Hill without feeding him the ball similar to how the Chiefs did with a rookie Tyreek Hill.It doesn‚Äôt quite make sense yet why Ruggs was drafted as a complementary receiver to a number one option (such as Courtland Sutton in Denver, Amari Cooper and Michael Gallup in Tennessee, Adam Thielen in Minnesota) when the Raiders were still looking for a number one option who may have more fit the mold of Jeudy, Lamb and Jefferson.It doesn‚Äôt quite make sense yet why Mayock would choose this draft, of all drafts, to prioritize a wide receiver instead of another position when we knew that the next eight or nine receivers off the board would also have number one upside. Is it really as simple as ‚ÄúNew city, same need for speed‚Äù?As it stands today, Jefferson, Lamb, Higgins and Jeudy all have more yards through nine weeks than any rookie receiver in 2019 and as you see, that is a talented group. Claypool would have more than all but McLaurin, who only had a few more yards through eight games. Even Aiyuk would rank highly and he‚Äôs only played in seven games.The world knew right away with McLaurin and Metcalf and Brown. We seem to know right away with a number of rookies this season too. But Ruggs is not that far off the pace from some 2018 rookies, including D.J. Chark (who had 159 yards in his first eight games) and D.J. Moore (who had 297). Not every explosive players booms in his first season and Edwards too may prove to be better than many of the receivers selected ahead of him.As the top receiver on the board, it is impossible for Ruggs to do that. Instead, he has to be better than the receivers draft behind him. The pressure to live up to those expectations may fall more on Mayock‚Äôs shoulders than on Ruggs‚Äô."

There have been some good game plans from other coaches, and there have been some good results on different days, but not one coach has seen as many injuries to his starting group, trotted out second-, third-, and even fourth-string players, and still seen admirable production.There have been many who have said all along that Cable was trash, that he should have been fired long ago, that think that he isn't even an NFL-capable coach. Well, once again, those people have shown that they don't really know jack about coaching, or possibly even football. Whether you, I, or we like or respect him as a person, he is indeed a top-shelf coach. The best thing for the team is that he has not really shown that he is HC material, and did not seem to inspire as co-OC. Although both efforts had some success, neither was deemed to have been due to him, and he was fired from both spots, with the OC at the time moving into the spot as HC, or the person that he shared duties with as OC taking sole possession of the role. What this means is that he is not as likely as it might be thought to be moving. It wouldn't seem that many teams will offer him the chance to be HC, OC is not a strong possibility (especially as his offense was run-oriented; not the preferred method of today's game), leaving only the OL/assistant HC position as the carrot to dangle for him to leave. Although it is an assumption on my part, I think that he will be fine with staying, with what looks to be a long-term job in a stable environment, on a team that continues to rise.Bottom line, without his work, this team would not be in the same position. Considering that he regularly not only has to start back-ups, but those back-ups are playing OUT OF POSITION, he has done a masterful job, and one that seems to not really be acknowledged anywhere near as much as it should."

Through the Raiders‚Äô first five games of the season, Las Vegas had only forced three turnovers total. They forced one each in the two games following that piece, but on Sunday against the Denver Broncos, they forced five.That doubles the Raiders‚Äô takeaway figure on the season from five to 10.Broncos quarterback Drew Lock is proving not to be the answer for Denver and he threw six interceptions in the four starts prior to facing Las Vegas this week. That came further off the rails beginning in the first quarter when Jeff Heath picked off Lock‚Äôs errant pass at his own 37 and returned it 24 yards.Jeff Heath picks off Drew Lock.pic.twitter.com/n175T8bsCFOn Denver‚Äôs next drive, Nicholas Morrow sacked Lock and forced a fumble, though Lock brought it back in. That type of ball security went out the window with the Raiders leading 10-6 and the Broncos driving deep into Las Vegas territory with only seconds remaining in the first half. Heath again intercepted Lock, this time taking points off the board and making sure the Raiders had a four-point lead at the break.That's ‚úåÔ∏è

That alone would be the most forced by a Raiders defense since Week 4 of 2018 (which was an overtime game against the Browns) and five turnovers is the most the franchise has had since Week 5 of the 2013 season.The Raiders are now fourth in points per drive, but giving credit to the offense without a hat tip to the defense would be a disservice."

We punched them in the mouth hard. It left the entire Chiefs Nation feeling confused, especially considering we did it in Arrowhead Stadium. They did not have the fans there to drown us out and the refs have been calling fair(er) games now that we‚Äôre Vegas‚Äô team, so they were left exposed for having a SOFT defense and a talented, yet SOFT offense. Andy Reid is taking this ""bus"" incident and using it as fuel to fire up his guys because he knows they are soft and the Autumn Wind is finally upon them. This bus thing is being blown way out of proportion and it is simply an intimidation tactic meant to make us worry to the point of us beating ourselves while they assist us.It is like the bullied kid (Raiders) finally stepping up to the bully (Chiefs) and knocking him clean out on his own turf (Arrowhead). Now all of his friends (the media) are in our ear telling us the bully wants his revenge tomorrow after school (week 11) in the hopes of scaring us into not showing up. Good. Let‚Äôs be there waiting for them when they arrive with our MMA gloves on ready to scrap. Yes, they will come out guns-a-blazing, as they ALWAYS DO, and we know this. So what‚Äôs new? We know they have speed. We know Mahomes is crafty. We know they can run. We need to have another surprise in store for them. An even worse physical beatdown to show them the first (and the many more to come) was not a fluke. We need to get PHYSICAL this game and take it to them right from the start and until the final second runs off of the clock.TLDR?We need to establish our DOMINANCE from the jump. Remember how the Washington Redskins‚Äô D-Line punched our O-line in the mouth September 2017? Let‚Äôs channel that same energy to our D-Line. Remember how the Bucs‚Äô Linebackers punched us in the mouth in week 7 this year? Our Linebackers need to channel that same energy. Remember how Jamal Adams singlehandedly punched us in the mouth in November 2019 with the Jets? Our safeties need to channel that same energy. Remember in November 2017 how Aqib Talib and the Broncos tried to punk Crabtree IN O.CO STADIUM (the nerve) by snatching his chain and then fighting him? Our cornerbacks need to bring that same energy to this game, minus the fighting of course. We need to be cold, calculated, killers. Let‚Äôs make a statement that the Chiefs, and the instigating media, and every other team in this league, and Shannon Sharpe, and Skip Bayless, and the haters, and the doubters, and the whole rest of the world will NEVER forget. We are the Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders and we‚Äôre here for blood. This week it's Chiefs blood. Win, lose, or draw, let‚Äôs make them never want to play against us ever again, home or away. But most importantly, let‚Äôs play smart, let's play safe, and let's get the W.RN4L!"

The Raiders were one of four teams to put in a waiver claim. The San Francisco 49ers and the Cleveland Browns also put in claims for him.The Bengals were awarded the 2017 first-round pick because NFL waivers is based off records and the Bengals had the worst record of the four claiming teams.RELATEDIf the 49ers, Browns and Raiders all claim McKinley again this week, the 49ers will get him. The Raiders have the lowest priority of the remaining teams.It was not disclosed why McKinley failed his physical, but if the Raiders feel like the reason is minor, it will be worth putting in another claim.McKinley is 25, he has 17.5 career sacks and his contract for the rest of the season is affordable at less than $1 million. The Raiders could use more pass-rush help, so the interest still may be there.Stay tuned ...UPDATE: The 49ers plan on claiming McKinley, so there you go."

Preston Williams of the Miami Dolphins.Williams had 32 catches on 60 targets for 428 yards, second-most among rookies behind the 458 by Terry McLaurin of the Washington Wedontcallthemthatanymores. DK Metcalf of the Seattle Seahawks was third at 402 yards.Through their team‚Äôs first eight games this season, Metcalf and McLaurin continue to dominate and they‚Äôve taken their successes to another level with another year of experience: Metcalf has 788 yards and eight touchdowns through eight games, McLaurin has 692 and a class-leading 50 receptions despite playing with Dwayne Haskins, Kyle Allen and Alex Smith, who at one point seemed less likely to make a comeback than the tight end Alex Smith who retired in 2015.There are some other receivers in the 2019 class who‚Äôve had varying levels of success in both seasons so far, of course.A.J. Brown of the Titans; Darius Slayton of the Giants; Marquise Brown of the Ravens; Mecole Hardman of the Chiefs; Diontae Johnson of the Steelers; Deebo Samuel of the 49ers; and of course, Hunter Renfrow. Williams went on injured reserve after eight games last season and that happened again in 2020, though he could return from his foot sprain.There have been a couple of examples of receivers having success in year two after not doing so as rookies, including Scotty Miller of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Travis Fulgham of the Philadelphia Eagles. And then there are the potential regrets.Not just that N‚ÄôKeal Harry of the Patriots, JJ Arcega-Whiteside of the Eagles, Parris Campbell of the Colts and Andy Isabella of the Cardinals might have been poor choices in the first and second rounds, but the mounds of regret that teams like the Ravens might have for choosing Hollywood Brown ‚Äî a decent player thus far ‚Äî over the likes of Brown, Metcalf and McLaurin. Or the Patriots being stuck with Harry instead of those players. The Eagles taking JJAW over DKM and TMcL.And maybe one day we‚Äôll be talking about how every team passed on Slayton, Fulgham, Miller and Renfrow.The good news about a loaded receiver class ‚Äî especially ones that come in back-to-back years ‚Äî is that you have greater odds of finding a hit. The bad news is that a moderate hit like Brown is still only a double compared to the home runs found on day two. And in the heavy passing, high-scoring world of 2020 football, ‚Äòships dig the long ball.The 2020 wide receiver class was meant to be even better than the one in 2019. While last year‚Äôs crop was plenty deep and overloaded with exciting options on day two, this year‚Äôs group had three players being bandied about as top-10 picks if the draft wasn‚Äôt also top-heavy at quarterback, tackle and cornerback. The Las Vegas Raiders were on the clock after 11 players were selected and none of the choices was a wide receiver.General manager Mike Mayock could select a wide receiver, as most expected the Raiders to do, or he could go outside of expectations and pick the best player available knowing that five, 10 or even 15 more interesting receivers could be left on the board when Las Vegas was back on the clock at 19. Mayock could even trade back (theoretically) and find ways to stockpile additional choices when the Raiders were without their next pick until 80 and 81 ... both of which were used on ‚Äúwide receivers.‚ÄùJon Gruden says it was a ‚Äútough call‚Äù to draft Henry Ruggs over Jerry Jeudy.

‚ÄúWe liked Jeudy a lot‚ÄùWell, one wide receiver, one Miami Dolphins running back.The decision to select Henry Ruggs III over either of those choices, as well as instead of Jerry Jeudy and CeeDee Lamb, was not an odd one. It was not a controversial one either. Some people preferred Jeudy. Some people preferred Lamb. Some people preferred Ruggs.The Broncos liked Henry Ruggs ‚Äúa lot‚Äù in the draft process, according to Fangio.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very, very fast‚ÄùPerhaps there was some risk with Ruggs because he wasn‚Äôt the highly productive number one option at Alabama like Jeudy was at the same school or like Lamb was at Oklahoma, but every draft pick carries different risks. Jeudy and Lamb will never have the physical attributes that Ruggs does and that may yet prove to matter.It just hasn‚Äôt proven to matter yet.If Mayock has screwed up anywhere in the 2020 draft ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not saying that he has because it‚Äôs only been a half of one rookie season, which is why I wanted to start out by highlighting the midway point for the 2019 class ‚Äî it is not necessarily with the selection of Ruggs but the miscalculation of either where the receiver talent would be available in the draft or his own ability to find the sleepers.Between Denzel Mims at pick 59 and Gabe Davis at pick 128, the only wide receivers selected were Bryan Edwards by Mayock and Devin Duvernay, who went to Baltimore. Mayock also chose Lynn Bowden, Jr., but he was placed at running back and then he was placed on the trade block. Edwards had a fantastic training camp and was off to a fine start before foot and shoulder injuries pushed him off the field, returning last week to play one snap against the LA Chargers, but what other options existed to Mayock now that we‚Äôve seen a half-season from this rookie class?The most obvious ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù scenario has to involve tackle Tristan Wirfs. Just Blog Baby compared him to ‚Äúabsolute monster of a man‚Äù Trent Brown after his dominant combine performance. How great would it have been for the Raiders to have a Trent Brown clone who above all else is not Trent Brown? Wirfs was selected by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers one pick after Las Vegas selected Ruggs and he‚Äôs been called a potential Pro Bowl player in his first NFL season.Making this choice of course means that the Raiders would still need to pick a receiver, something Mayock clearly wasn‚Äôt going to leave the draft without doing at least twice.Midway through 2020, Ruggs ranks 10th among rookie receivers in yards, having played in six of a possible eight games. He has 10 catches for 220 yards, displaying the same low-volume, high-yardage-per-catch output he had with the Crimson Tide.Gruden mentioned possibly working Henry Ruggs in some sideline drills this week & it‚Äôs a good idea. This one & the TD last week are two big plays he would have made if he got both feet in. It‚Äôs not uncommon for rookies to need to work on this once in the NFL. #RaiderNation pic.twitter.com/YBgpiApBZDComparatively, Jeudy has caught 30 passes for 484 yards with the Denver Broncos and Lamb has caught 44 passes for 595 yards with the Dallas Cowboys; unsurprisingly, Lamb has caught only eight of 17 passes for 98 yards in the last three games and is less productive without Dak Prescott as his quarterback. Lamb is not the most productive rookie though.That belongs to Justin Jefferson of the Vikings, who has caught 34 passes for 627 yards and ranks first in both DVOA and DYAR at FootballOutsiders. Not among rookies, but among all receivers. Jefferson went 22nd in the draft and would have been available at 19 if the Raiders had opted to go in another direction at pick 12. Or if they wanted to double down on receivers in the first round, since the selection of Edwards clearly indicates that the position was that important to Mayock and Jon Gruden.Justin Jefferson with a nasty double move: pic.twitter.com/5KdlujI9YtThose aren‚Äôt the only four rookie receivers of note either.Tee Higgins of the Bengals has 33 catches for 488 yards and he‚Äôs become more dominant over the last five games (413 yards in that stretch); Chase Claypool of the Steelers has 31 catches for 444 yards and seven total touchdowns; Brandon Aiyuk of the 49ers has 371 yards, including 206 in the last two weeks; Darnell Mooney of the Bears, Laviska Shenault of the Jaguars and Davis with the Bills have also all topped 275 yards thus far and have proven to be dependable, interesting prospects.Is Tee Higgins playing like a top 10 WR?

Since Week 4, the #Bengals rookie has earned a @PFF receiving grade of 83.4, while averaging 2.43 yards per route run. Both of those marks rank 10th among 104 WRs in that span.

Safe to say Higgins has impressed.
pic.twitter.com/j03dWsC6LzThe challenge for Mayock and Gruden won‚Äôt be to justify the Ruggs and Damon Arnette and Bryan Edwards picks based only on what they end up doing (the Bowden pick has already been called ‚Äúunjustified,‚Äù though maybe you don‚Äôt feel that way), but also based on what the other options they could have had end up doing relative to those players.Highest YAC per reception by WRs:
1. Deebo Samuel - 13.3
2. Henry Ruggs III - 10.0
3. Jalen Guyton - 9.8 pic.twitter.com/cgUQHMtFTNIt is also relative to where the Raiders‚Äô issues and roster holes will be popping up and their decision to pass on players like Wirfs.Since Ruggs returned from an injury in Week 5 to put up 118 yards (on two catches) in a win against the Chiefs, prompting Gruden to say ‚ÄúWell, yeah, we did not bring him in here to run hitch routes‚Äù and that Ruggs was a ‚Äúgreat route runner‚Äù who needed to get the ball more, he‚Äôs been targeted a total of 10 times, catching four passes for 43 yards and no touchdowns. He also has three carries for 21 yards. Las Vegas has scored an average of 22 points per game in that stretch but has managed to pull out a 2-1 record from those games.Ruggs caught zero of his three targets against the Chargers in Week 9.It was hard to find comparisons to Ruggs in the 2020 draft and it is hard to find comparisons for him in NFL history, which is what makes him the most exciting theoretical receiver prospect in the class (which continues to be true today), but the closest that people have mentioned is Tyreek Hill. The Chiefs did not extract much yardage value out of Hill over his first six career games, but it is worth comparing him to Ruggs, who is also one year younger than Hill was in 2016.Hill caught 14 of 17 targets for 125 yards over his first six games in the NFL. He was playing with Alex Smith (the quarterback, not the retired tight end) and only averaged 7.3 yards per target and 8.9 yards per catch. However, he also scored three touchdowns and was returning kickoffs and punts.Over the final 10 games of his rookie season, Hill caught 47 of 66 targets for 468 yards and carried the ball 19 times for 250 rushing yards, scoring a total of six touchdowns.Lots of impressive rookie WRs this year:

- Justin Jefferson
- CeeDee Lamb
- Tee Higgins
- Jerry Jeudy
- Chase Claypool
- Brandon Aiyuk
- Darnell Mooney
- Henry Ruggs
- etc.

Remember, rookie WRs are typically far more productive in the 2nd half of their rookie seasons pic.twitter.com/0gNRXcSd8JThough I do not have Hill‚Äôs average depth of target from his rookie season, those numbers begin to show up on Pro-Football-Reference in 2018, I would be surprised if it comes close to the 19.8 ADOT that Ruggs has on his first 21 targets. Kansas City was putting the ball in Hill‚Äôs hands and Smith was rarely passing deep to Hill.According to P-F-R, Smith was 4 of 13 on deep passes to Hill and backup Nick Foles was 2 of 2. That‚Äôs 15 total deep passes to Hill over 16 games.Through six games together, Derek Carr is three of 10 on deep passes to Ruggs. That does mean that Carr has completed three deep passes for 163 yards and a touchdown. It also means that he‚Äôs missed seven deep passes to Ruggs.And by the way, six of Ruggs‚Äô 10 catches have gone for six or fewer yards. It‚Äôs been a battle of ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù with this particular pick as opposed to Las Vegas going for a wide receiver like Jeudy, Lamb, Jefferson, Higgins, Claypool or Aiyuk, who have been regularly targeted options already.The Raiders are on pace to be led in receiving by tight end Darren Waller (who has 50 catches for only 394 yards in eight games) and then Renfrow, who has 27 catches for 369 and two touchdowns. Nelson Agholor has 17 catches for 347 yards, giving Las Vegas the deep play threat that they assumed Ruggs needed to be; Carr is six of eight on deep passes to Agholor, including four touchdowns.It doesn‚Äôt quite make sense yet how Gruden is utilizing Ruggs; they‚Äôre using him like a veteran Tyreek Hill without feeding him the ball similar to how the Chiefs did with a rookie Tyreek Hill.It doesn‚Äôt quite make sense yet why Ruggs was drafted as a complementary receiver to a number one option (such as Courtland Sutton in Denver, Amari Cooper and Michael Gallup in Tennessee, Adam Thielen in Minnesota) when the Raiders were still looking for a number one option who may have more fit the mold of Jeudy, Lamb and Jefferson.It doesn‚Äôt quite make sense yet why Mayock would choose this draft, of all drafts, to prioritize a wide receiver instead of another position when we knew that the next eight or nine receivers off the board would also have number one upside. Is it really as simple as ‚ÄúNew city, same need for speed‚Äù?As it stands today, Jefferson, Lamb, Higgins and Jeudy all have more yards through nine weeks than any rookie receiver in 2019 and as you see, that is a talented group. Claypool would have more than all but McLaurin, who only had a few more yards through eight games. Even Aiyuk would rank highly and he‚Äôs only played in seven games.The world knew right away with McLaurin and Metcalf and Brown. We seem to know right away with a number of rookies this season too. But Ruggs is not that far off the pace from some 2018 rookies, including D.J. Chark (who had 159 yards in his first eight games) and D.J. Moore (who had 297). Not every explosive players booms in his first season and Edwards too may prove to be better than many of the receivers selected ahead of him.As the top receiver on the board, it is impossible for Ruggs to do that. Instead, he has to be better than the receivers draft behind him. The pressure to live up to those expectations may fall more on Mayock‚Äôs shoulders than on Ruggs‚Äô."

According to a source, the total value of the deal, including this season, is $105.5 million, including incentives. The extension itself is worth $92 million and up to $94 million, meaning an average of $23 million and perhaps as much as $23.5 million.According to NFL Network, it includes a $30 million signing bonus and a total of $30 million in roster bonuses due in March 2021, 2022 and 2023.Clearly, there is prestige with being No. 1 in anything, and that includes No. 1 in contract.‚ÄúYeah, that was something that I‚Äôve been chasing for a while,‚Äù Bakhtiari said after a 24-20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. ‚ÄúHaving the talks with my family, to have that monetary validation for all the work that I‚Äôve put in really meant a lot. That was something that I can hold onto and have that title for the rest of my life. That is something that is special, that I‚Äôve been chasing really ever since I got in the league. I have goals, very lofty, lofty ones. I always wanted to say that I was the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history and today I get to say that.‚ÄùAfter Saturday‚Äôs team meetings, Bakhtiari said he got a call from his agent, Mark Humenik of IHC Sports, telling Bakhtiari they needed to talk.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs either good news or bad news,‚Äù Bakhtiari said.It was good news. Very good news.‚ÄúThe one thing that I had trusted him with,‚Äù Bakhtiari said, ‚Äúand I told him I was going to ask this question before I‚Äôd ever sign was, he needs to be able to confidently say that this contract is deserving for the highest-paid offensive lineman. I remember I explicitly asked him and he told me, ‚ÄòYes, it is.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòOK, then let‚Äôs do it.‚Äô‚ÄùBakhtiari said he signed the contract at 11 p.m. Saturday. He called it a ‚Äúweight lifted off your shoulders‚Äù to sign his second four-year extension since being a fourth-round draft pick in 2013.‚ÄúI‚Äôm really happy for him,‚Äù quarterback and best friend Aaron Rodgers said. ‚ÄúI was privy to some of the conversations that were going on and was wondering where we were going to get to before the end of this year. ‚ÄúObviously, wrapping him up seemed to be of some benefit to the organization long term, best left tackle in the game, future Hall of Famer, probably. Very happy for him. He‚Äôs having a big year, man. He‚Äôs got a great woman he got engaged with and got a long-term extension that pays him the way he deserves to be paid. He‚Äôs having a hell of a year, he‚Äôs a special player and he‚Äôs a great locker room guy. Pretty happy for him.‚ÄùBakhtiari‚Äôs payday came on the eve of his return to the lineup after missing three games with what was called a chest injury. In reality, he said it was a broken rib.As he‚Äôs done throughout his career, Bakhtiari toughed it out.‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this pad little pad thing, had a flap. Rub some dirt on it. I mean, there‚Äôs only so much,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can protect it, but other than that ‚Ä¶ The one thing was to make sure I was safe, and once we were good on that. I mean, you just have to, I‚Äôve got to be able to play and play well. not put myself or anyone else out there in harm. Once we got to that point, we got the green light on both sides, and I was just excited to get back out there. because I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy sitting on the sidelines.‚ÄùSunday‚Äôs victory was part of a big weekend for Bakhtiari, one that will be capped by more than a can of celebratory beer on Sunday night.It will be a well-deserved celebration. Of the 32 starting left tackles, 19 were selected in the first round. Another five went in the second, Bakhtiari is an outlier as a fourth-round pick. The Packers didn‚Äôt necessarily view him as a left tackle coming out of Colorado. But the man who replaced Bryan Bulaga in the starting lineup in his rookie training camp has built himself into an elite performer.Bakhtiari ‚Äúworked himself into an elite left tackle,‚Äù general manager Brian Gutekunst said.Gutekunst visited the Colorado campus during the 2012 season and came away impressed with Bakhtiari‚Äôs play and work ethic on a really bad team.‚ÄúWe really probably had him ranked much higher than actually where we ended up drafting him,‚Äù Gutekunst said. ‚ÄúWe really thought he had a chance to be a good player in the National Football League. Did we know that he was going to become an elite left tackle? I don‚Äôt know if we could have predicted that or we would have taken him a lot sooner.‚ÄùThe Packers signed Bakhtiari to a four-year extension just before the 2016 opener at Jacksonville. And they did it again just before Sunday‚Äôs game against Jacksonville.Asked what he would have told a teenage version of himself had he been told he‚Äôd be the highest-paid lineman in NFL history, Bakhtiari got emotional.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a liar. You can‚Äôt ever have something, you don‚Äôt really know how to measure someone‚Äôs heart, someone‚Äôs passion, someone‚Äôs work ethic, and that teenager wasn‚Äôt the most physically gifted but he had everything else that pushed him to be where he is today. That‚Äôs what I would have looked that teenager in the face and told.‚ÄùFollow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

1,packers,https://www.si.com/nfl/packers/news/lacking-juice-packers-almost-get-squeezed-again,"Lacking Juice, Packers Almost Get Squeezed Again","Bill HuberGREEN BAY, Wis. ‚Äì Desperate times call for desperate measures.Well, maybe times haven‚Äôt quite reached desperation level for the Green Bay Packers. After all, they‚Äôre 7-2 following a 24-20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. Nonetheless, on the heels of a loss to the Minnesota Vikings two weeks ago, the Packers turned in another lethargic performance at home against one of the NFL‚Äôs bottom-feeders.In the absence of the typical 78,000 fans that bring Lambeau Field to life, Rodgers wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing some of the between-series goofiness.‚ÄúI told Matt (LaFleur), I want to see ‚ÄòRoll Out the Barrel.‚Äô I want the beer races. I want ‚ÄòSign, Sign, Everywhere a Sign.‚Äô I want ‚ÄòYMCA,‚Äô‚Äù Rodgers said after the game. ‚ÄúI want the favorites. I don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre shying away from some of those but, hey, I‚Äôm just one man.‚ÄùNo different than the loss to the Vikings, who were 1-5 at the time, LaFleur lamented the lack of urgency and passion against the Jaguars, who fell to 1-8. Even a question about how his defense rose to the occasion to preserve the victory turned into a dialogue about the lack of emotion.As always, LaFleur pointed the finger first at himself and his coaching staff.‚ÄúI think every player, everybody involved with this team, has got to look deep inside of them and understand and appreciate the opportunity to go out there and compete,‚Äù LaFleur said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs special when you get a chance to go play a football game in the National Football League. And we‚Äôve got to do a better job of bringing more juice, just bringing a tougher mind-set to the gameday ‚Äì especially when we‚Äôre at home. I don‚Äôt know what it is about the last couple games here at Lambeau, but certainly it hasn‚Äôt been our best and we‚Äôve got to be better.‚ÄùGreen Bay dominated the game statistically. It wound up with overwhelming advantages of 395-260 in total yards and 6.6-4.3 in total yards. Rodgers doubled rookie counterpart Jake Luton in passing yards and crushed him by 45.4 points in passer rating.Juice had nothing to do with JK Scott‚Äôs low, line-drive punt that was returned for a touchdown. Juice had nothing to do with Davante Adams‚Äô fumble early in the third quarter, which the Jags turned into the tying touchdown. Juice had nothing to do with Rodgers‚Äô interception late in the third quarter, which the Jags turned into the go-ahead field goal. That‚Äôs 17 of the 20 points allowed. And maybe this juicy conversation would have been tastier had the wind not blown a third-down deep shot to Robert Tonyan out of his reach on the opening possession.Regardless, Green Bay‚Äôs first three possessions ended in punts. Scott didn‚Äôt punt that many times in four of the first eight games. Jacksonville running back James Robinson rushed for 61 yards in the first half.The combination of a slow start and some huge miscues put the Packers on the ropes against one of the worst teams in the NFL.What‚Äôs the problem?‚ÄúIf I knew, it definitely wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, right?‚Äù LaFleur said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to do some investigating, obviously. And look at myself first. But that wasn‚Äôt good enough, there‚Äôs no doubt about it. In terms of just the energy, the passion, we‚Äôre playing football. These guys are playing a kids game, and getting paid for it, man. It‚Äôs disturbing to me. And it starts with myself and our staff. We‚Äôve got to bring more energy for these guys.‚ÄùNonetheless, the Packers improved to 7-2. With Seattle losing to the Los Angeles Rams, the Packers and Saints are now tied atop the NFC. With Green Bay beating New Orleans in Week 3, LaFleur, Rodgers and the rest of the team went to bed on Sunday as the frontrunner for the No. 1 seed and the conference‚Äôs lone playoff bye.Without fans in Lambeau Field anytime soon to help provide the energy that‚Äôs been lacking, do the Packers have a worthy homefield advantage?‚ÄúObviously, having a loud fan base is important and feeling the energy, especially for the defensive players, is very important,‚Äù Rodgers said. ‚ÄúBut getting warmer weather or dome teams up here in December and January has always been a good advantage for us. We‚Äôve thrown the ball well in bad weather, we‚Äôve won big games in the bad weather. Getting a home game in January, with or without fans ‚Äì hopefully with ‚Äì will definitely be an advantage for us.‚ÄùFollow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

2,packers,https://www.si.com/nfl/packers/news/whats-next-for-packers-after-signing-david-bakhtiari,"With Bakhtiari Signed, What‚Äôs Next for Unprecedented Offseason?","Bill HuberGREEN BAY, Wis. ‚Äì Green Bay Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst took care of the biggest and most important domino by signing left tackle David Bakhtiari to a monster contract extension on Saturday.Now, it‚Äôll be up to Gutekunst to build a team around Aaron Rodgers, who will have the third-highest cap charge among quarterbacks in 2021, Davante Adams, who will have the sixth-highest cap charge among receivers, Za‚ÄôDarius Smith, who will have the seventh-highest cap charge among edge rushers and now Bakhtiari, who is scheduled to have the third-highest cap charge among offensive tackles.Teams face an unprecedented challenge due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With no fans buying tickets into the stadium to watch a game ‚Äì and perhaps buy a beer or three ‚Äì the salary cap is expected to fall from $198.2 million this year to $175 million next year. That‚Äôs a dip of $23.2 million for a league accustomed to annual increases in the neighborhood of $10 million. Nobody budgeted for the calamity that‚Äôs to come.RELATED: Bakhtiari goes from fourth-round pick to king of offensive tackles‚ÄúI think this was actually an important part of what we‚Äôre trying to do,‚Äù Gutekunst said on Sunday. ‚ÄúAs we move forward in ‚Äô21, which is going to be a challenging year for everyone in the National Football league, this gives us a little bit more flexibility moving forward. Obviously, David is a very important part of our team. I think he approaches it the right way. Takes care of himself, works really hard. It‚Äôs very important to him. I think he really wanted to be here. It actually gives us a little more flexibility to move forward.‚ÄùGreen Bay will use some accounting to lessen the blow. Bakhtiari‚Äôs contract includes three huge roster bonuses totaling $30 million. The expectation is Green Bay will turn the 2021 roster bonus into signing bonus, which will shift some of that money away from the 2021 salary cap and put it on the 2022, 2023 and 2024 caps, when the financial picture for teams will be much, much brighter.Once that is done, Bakhtiari‚Äôs 2021 cap charge will be about $11.143 million. That‚Äôs about $3 million less than what it would have cost to use the franchise tag, with the obvious benefit of having a four-time All-Pro at a premium position under contract through 2024.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some avenues as we move forward that allows us to reduce his number in the next couple years that maybe we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do if we couldn‚Äôt come to agreement,‚Äù Gutekunst said.As it stands, based on OverTheCap.com‚Äôs projections, the Packers have about $2.166 million of cap space for 2021. That, however, includes only the 39 players under contract in 2021. Offseason caps are based on the 51 most-expensive contracts. That reality actually puts Green Bay in the hole by about $5.75 million. Moreover, that figure doesn‚Äôt include Bakhtiari‚Äôs contract. So, making Bakhtiari the 40th player on a 51-man roster, the Packers would be in the neighborhood of $16.3 million over the cap.Releasing outside linebacker Preston Smith, safety Adrian Amos and right tackle Rick Wagner would do the trick, but only barely, so there would be no money to re-sign running back Aaron Jones, center Corey Linsley, or to make any outside additions to the roster.One option would be to extend receiver Davante Adams. Next season will be his final one under contract. He‚Äôs due a base salary of $12 million and has a cap charge of $16.6 million. Tacking on years would be a win-win for the Packers, as it would lock up a premier player while creating immediate cap space.With the Packers among 13 teams projected to be over the cap, based on OTC‚Äôs projections, there could be a flood of quality players on the market. Can Gutekunst and Russ Ball find a way to take advantage?‚ÄúI think obviously we have some players that are coming up that we‚Äôd certainly like to re-sign if we can,‚Äù Gutekunst said. ‚ÄúThis year I think is going to be a unique free agent class, only because a lot of teams are going to be trying to get under the number. The players that might become available to us during the March period may be a little different than it has in the past, and we want to have some flexibility to do those things if we can. So, I think it‚Äôs a combination of that. We‚Äôve always believed that we‚Äôd like to take care of our own first, that‚Äôs very important to us, but we‚Äôd also like to have some flexibility to see what the market might bring in March.‚ÄùFollow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

I think there‚Äôs more of a, ‚ÄòOh, you know, Doc doesn‚Äôt think I can go here. Maybe I should sit out the rest of the game.‚Äô But 17‚Äôs built different. He always has been. And for him to get back out there, I asked him a couple of times, I said, ‚ÄòAre you OK? You good?‚Äô And he just nodded that he was.‚ÄùBeyond the touchdown, Rodgers and Adams continued their remarkable seasons with understated performances.Rodgers threw for 325 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday. While he did toss one interception, he finished the day with a 108.1 passer rating.With that, Rodgers has eight games with at least two touchdown passes and a 100-plus rating this season, marking the fourth time that a quarterback has done so in eight of his first nine games of a season in NFL history. Rodgers (all nine games in 2011), Tom Brady (eight in 2007 with the Patriots) and Philip Rivers (eight in 2018 with the Chargers) mark the only other occasions.Adams caught eight passes for 66 yards and the one touchdown. In his seven games this season, he has 61 receptions for 741 yards and nine touchdowns. Adams and Hall of Famers Marvin Harrison (1999 with the Colts) and Randy Moss (2007 with the Vikings) are the only players in NFL history with at least 700 receiving yards and nine touchdown receptions in their first seven games of a season in the Super Bowl era. Moreover, Adams‚Äô 61 receptions are the fifth-most by a player in his first seven games of a season in NFL history.‚ÄúThe dude‚Äôs a special player,‚Äù Rodgers said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one-of-a-kind and he never ceases to grow my respect.‚ÄùFollow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

He was a total afterthought in the preseason odds after a couple subpar seasons and the lack of additions at receiver.Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who won NFL MVP in 2018 and Super Bowl MVP in 2019, has vaulted to the top of the race at 7/4. Mahomes has a 115.9 passer rating and an incredible 25 touchdowns vs. one interception as the Chiefs are 8-1.Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, who had become an overwhelming favorite after the team‚Äôs 5-0 start, has thrown seven interceptions as the Seahawks have lost three of their last four games. Wilson leads the NFL with 28 touchdown passes to propel Seattle's 6-3 start. He‚Äôs fallen to 5/2.Rodgers boasts a 116.4 passer rating on the strength of 26 touchdowns vs. three interceptions for the 7-2 Packers. In nine games, he has eight games with at least two touchdown passes and a 100-plus rating, marking the fourth time that a quarterback has done so in eight of his first nine games of a season in NFL history. Rodgers did it in all nine games in 2011.‚ÄúThis was Wilson‚Äôs award to win mainly because his defense has been so bad. Wilson by his standards has been really bad in three of his last four games,‚Äù said Ed Salmons, SuperBook‚Äôs vice president of risk management and oddsmaking. ‚ÄúMahomes now seems poised to take the award and run with it. He should have plenty of chances to continue to add to his ridiculous numbers this year, which have been pretty much ignored by the media. And he had to play two games in really bad weather [at Buffalo and at Denver in snow]. Rodgers has been very consistent and just doesn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs an MVP but his numbers sure add up.‚ÄùThe other player in a four-man race is Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray, who has moved to 8/1. The Cardinals have won four of their last five games on the strength of the ultra-athletic quarterback who is on pace for 4,222 passing yards and 1,074 rushing yards while producing 27 of the team‚Äôs 32 touchdowns.The top eight in the MVP race are in the video.Follow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

16,packers,https://www.si.com/nfl/packers/news/packers-colts-keys-to-game,Five Days to Kickoff: 5 Packers-Colts Keys to Game,"Bill HuberGREEN BAY, Wis. ‚Äì Led by Aaron Rodgers, Davante Adams and Aaron Jones, the Green Bay Packers are third in the NFL in scoring. However, they‚Äôve fattened up on a bunch of high-calorie cupcakes.Six of their games have come against teams that rank in the bottom 10 in points allowed: Minnesota (twice), Detroit, Atlanta, Houston and Jacksonville. Only two games have come against defenses in the top 10 in points allowed. One was Tampa Bay, which dominated the Packers over the final three quarters so thoroughly that Green Bay didn‚Äôt take a single snap from the Bucs‚Äô side of the field. The other was San Francisco, which shouldn‚Äôt count because its roster has been destroyed by injuries.The challenge for Rodgers and Co. will be much more difficult on Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts are fourth in points allowed. They‚Äôre first in yards allowed per carry and first in opponent passer rating.The return of Jones from a calf injury hasn‚Äôt provided much of a jolt. Green Bay averaged just 3.2 yards per carry in an ugly win over Jacksonville. Meanwhile, until allowing 4.9 yards per carry against Derrick Henry and the powerful Titans last week, the Colts had allowed merely 2.9 yards per carry their previous five games.With a combination of pressure and coverage, the Colts‚Äô pass defense has been exceptional. If Green Bay can‚Äôt run the ball, it could be a long day.Here are the rest of this week‚Äôs keys to the game.During his time with the Chargers, Colts quarterback Philip Rivers lit up the Packers. In four career games, he averaged 373 passing yards.The Colts hoped Rivers ‚Äì No. 5 all-time in passing yards ‚Äì could make them contenders after they were sent reeling by the retirement of Andrew Luck. While he‚Äôs on pace for an eighth consecutive season of 4,000 passing yards, he is only 22nd with a passer rating of 93.6. In losses to Jacksonville, Cleveland and Baltimore, he threw one touchdown vs. five interceptions. In six wins, he‚Äôs thrown 10 touchdowns vs. two interceptions.The Packers, obviously, would get a big boost if Jaire Alexander (concussion) and Kevin King (quad) are good to go.The Colts made a second-round splash by drafting Jonathan Taylor, the record-breaking running back from Wisconsin. Taylor has started every game and leads the team in rushing but his playing time has dropped week by week. Now, it‚Äôs Nyheim Hines who is the team‚Äôs top back.A fourth-round pick from North Carolina State in 2018, Hines rushed 12 times for 70 yards against Tennessee last week, is the team‚Äôs leading receiver with 33 receptions and returns punts in his free time.Indy‚Äôs running game has been disappointing. Despite having a highly touted offensive line, the Colts are 29th with 3.76 yards per carry. Of course, the Packers‚Äô run defense has been Charmin soft for most of the season, though it did limit James Robinson to 48 yards on 14 carries in the second half (3.4 average) compared to 61 yards on nine carries (6.8) in the first half.Here‚Äôs one of the big statistical mismatches. According to Pro Football Reference, Indianapolis has missed only 35 tackles in nine games. That‚Äôs a league-best 3.9 per game. Green Bay has missed 71; that rate of 7.9 per game being the seventh-most.Against a strong defense like Indy‚Äôs, can the Packers make something happen? Two understated plays on Sunday were Jamaal Williams breaking a tackle on a pass on third-and-7 in the second quarter to get the first down and set up a touchdown, and Marquez Valdes-Scantling running through two tackles for an 18-yard gain to set up Davante Adams‚Äô winning touchdown. However, those plays have been outliers. In fact, according to PFR, Green Bay has forced 24 missed tackles ‚Äì the eighth-fewest in the NFL. In fact, MVS‚Äôs two missed tackles on that play represent 40 percent of the receiver corps‚Äô woeful total of five by our unofficial count.Just don‚Äôt screw things up.That should be the mantra of every special teams coordinator. Shawn Mennenga‚Äôs special teams have given up huge plays in two of the last four games, with a blocked punt against Houston and a punt returned for a touchdown against Jacksonville.Colts kickoff returner Isaiah Rodgers has a 101-yard touchdown and Hines has averaged 8.9 yards per punt return. Meanwhile, Packers punter JK Scott is third-from-last in net average and returner Tyler Ervin suffered injured ribs against the Jaguars.Mennenga‚Äôs units hit their stride late last season. Starting a similar upward swing against the Colts would be huge.Follow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

USAA holds the designation of Official NFL Salute to Service Partner.Bakken has been with the team since 1994 and is always quick to point out his appreciation for the men and women that serve our country and fight for our freedom. Tom‚Äôs military involvement with the Packers began during the 2001-2002 season. Due to lack of coordination, flyovers were no longer taking place at Lambeau Field during our national anthem.Knowing the impact and symbolism that flyovers provide for the fans and players, Tom was determined to make them a part of the Packers‚Äô opening ceremonies once again. With support from the team, Tom scheduled and coordinated his first flyover at Lambeau Field. With the success of the flyover, Tom was instantly ‚Äúhired,‚Äù as the Packers‚Äô coordinator of flyovers. In addition to his duties as an Assistant Equipment Manager, Tom was now in charge of scheduling and hosting the military members that perform this inspiring and uplifting pre-game spectacle.After the Packers had just won Super Bowl XLV, five days after Tom and the team landed back in Green Bay, he took nine Packers players on a military appreciation trip. The group visited members of the United States military stationed in and off the coast of Bahrain, Jordan, Pakistan and Afghanistan to name a few. Even though the Packers were on top of the sports world, there were men and women from the United States that were making it possible on the other side of the world. Tom always does his best to make sure they feel appreciated for all of the sacrifices that they have made for us.

24,packers,https://www.si.com/nfl/packers/news/4-views-from-inside-the-colts,Four Days to Kickoff: 4 Views from Inside the Colts,"Bill HuberGREEN BAY, Wis. ‚Äì The Green Bay Packers (7-2) play at the Indianapolis Colts (6-3) in a big showdown at 3:25 p.m. Sunday. Let‚Äôs get to know the foe with Phillip B. Wilson of Sports Illustrated‚Äôs All Colts.1. Philip Rivers has destroyed the Packers in his four starts, averaging about 375 yards per game. Obviously, Rivers is getting up there in years and he doesn‚Äôt throw it like he did once upon a time, but how has he played and how has he fit this season? And as a follow-up, who has stood out, if anyone, from a tightly packed group of pass catchers?When Rivers doesn‚Äôt throw an interception, the Colts are 4-0. That‚Äôs when he‚Äôs efficient, spreading the ball around and resisting the temptation to take risks. In the other games, when the Colts are 2-3, he has five TDs and seven interceptions. He still throws the inexplicable interception, most notably an incredibly bad pick-six at Cleveland in which the receiver wasn‚Äôt open and the ball seemed like it was thrown to the defender.The Colts are coming off their best win at Tennessee, in which they utilized Rivers‚Äô smarts in the no-huddle to exploit a Titans defense that has allowed yards in chunks and failed to generate a pass rush. Rivers gets rid of the ball quickly out of necessity because he‚Äôs immobile. That means defenses try to crowd the box to limit the short dump-off passes to running backs. The Colts have struggled to stretch the field and haven‚Äôt been good on third down and in the red zone, so it‚Äôs fair to question if Rivers was worth $25 million. If he gets the Colts to the playoffs, perhaps that answer is yes, but at 38 and in his 17th season, it sure doesn‚Äôt seem like he would be worth another year at that price. The Colts and Rivers have expressed the hope this marriage would last for at least another year.Wide receiver T.Y. Hilton is no longer the four-time Pro Bowl star most remember, although he has drawn seven penalties for 71 yards, so he can still get open with his route-running and force defenders to grab him. But because he‚Äôs not the No. 1 speed threat of the past, the Colts quickly resorted to using several different receivers. Rookie Michael Pittman Jr., a second-round choice, looks like the most talented. Although he missed three games due to surgery for leg compartment syndrome, he had his best game with seven catches for 101 yards as well as a 21-yard rush against the Titans. He‚Äôs a big target that Rivers likes, and has the size and speed to either elude defenders or run over them.Zach Pascal leads the wide receivers with 28 receptions, and he quietly goes unnoticed, but he‚Äôs reliable and, like Pittman, is an excellent blocker outside. The fact that running back Nyheim Hines has a team-high 33 receptions speaks to how the Colts use those checkdown or dump-off throws like runs because the rushing game hasn‚Äôt been as productive as last year. Tight end Mo Alie-Cox has also emerged as a capable playmaker, although he doesn‚Äôt get as many touches as he should.2. Jonathan Taylor will forever be a legend in Wisconsin. In my 30-some years of really watching football, there are two players who you just felt could go the distance every time he touched the football. One was Adrian Peterson with the Vikings. The other was Taylor with the Badgers. However, he‚Äôs played less and less as his rookie season has progressed. Can you give us a midseason report card on Taylor? Is there a sense of disappointment?Thrust into the starting role after the Colts lost Marlon Mack for the season in the second quarter of Week 1, Taylor has shown flashes of potential. The Colts won‚Äôt say it, but they expect to see more. He has 428 rushing yards and averages 3.8 yards per carry with four TDs, and he‚Äôs added 22 catches for 203 yards. But the Colts sure haven‚Äôt treated him like a starter lately. Despite a promising start against Baltimore two games ago, his first lost fumble in the NFL was returned for a tying touchdown and got him benched. In the last three games, he has 24 carries for 61 yards. A lot of those were in predictable run situations with the box stacked.The Colts have said they stuck with the hot hand with Jordan Wilkins at Detroit and Hines at Tennessee, but Taylor is the best rusher on this roster. Some are quick to criticize his lack of production, but again, the Colts haven‚Äôt put him in ideal situations too many times. This team has struggled in short yardage, regardless of who runs the ball. At some point, Taylor is going to prove he‚Äôs worthy of more touches and have the kind of game that reminds everyone why he was drafted in the second round. He‚Äôs hard on himself, but shouldn‚Äôt shoulder the blame for the Colts being among the worst in rush yards per carry.3. The offensive line is supposed to be great. And to be sure, defenses have hardly laid a finger on Rivers. But the run game hasn‚Äôt really gotten going. What‚Äôs the story? That‚Äôs a big question because Green Bay‚Äôs run defense isn‚Äôt good.The Colts adopted the ‚ÄúRun The Damn Ball‚Äù mantra last year, and it worked as the offense finished seventh in rushing yards, despite having a limited quarterback who didn‚Äôt throw the ball down the field. That still didn‚Äôt matter because the O-line was solid. A year later, with that line returning intact, it hasn‚Äôt been even remotely the same. Part of it is predictable play-calling, with too many runs in key situations designed to just follow All-Pro left guard Quenton Nelson and Pro Bowl center Ryan Kelly. Defensive coordinators expect it, and those plays get stuffed too often.But perhaps the more revealing explanation is Rivers. Because the Colts have a quarterback who can‚Äôt move, a greater emphasis was placed on pass protection. As a result, the Colts lead the NFL in fewest sacks allowed. But the run blocking has suffered. Coach Frank Reich, who calls the plays, insists that running the ball is still this team‚Äôs identity. But based on the statistics and what he‚Äôs called, it‚Äôs obvious the Colts must pass more to set up the run. That means they don‚Äôt run the ball as much, nor is it as effective.4. Defensively, Indianapolis is only No. 1 in yards allowed per carry and No. 1 in opponent passer rating. And yet, other than Darius Leonard and Xavier Rhodes, there‚Äôs really not anyone on the unit that a casual Packers fan would recognize. Can you give us two or three keys to the success of what will be the best defense the Packers have faced this season?The No. 1 key to this significant defensive improvement has been the March acquisition of All-Pro defensive tackle DeForest Buckner. As a disruptive three-technique defender, he leads the team in quarterback hits and demands so much attention that linebackers Darius Leonard and Bobby Okereke are freed up to make more plays. Teams that don‚Äôt double Buckner pay for it.His position is vital to a triangle scheme that coordinator Matt Eberflus employs, which relies upon three key playmakers in Buckner, Leonard, and nickel cornerback Kenny Moore II. The Colts have lacked a player like Buckner on the D-line to make this work until now. The Colts have 11 interceptions largely because they‚Äôve put enough pressure on quarterbacks to force mistakes. This team has been inconsistent in sacks, but pressures/hits have been the key in most games.5 Days: Five Keys to the GameFollow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

He‚Äôs missed the last five games but practiced the last three weeks, a remarkably quick comeback. While he did not practice on Friday, that was all part of the plan to make sure he is ready for this game.The Packers had 21 days to activate Lazard or put him on season-ending injured reserve; that deadline was Tuesday.‚ÄúWhen you look at Allen Lazard, certainly he was a guy that when we first got here, the only guy that really had much exposure to him was (offensive coordinator Nathaniel) Hackett and he‚Äôs grown [a lot] in this last year-and-a-half,‚Äù coach Matt LaFleur said last week. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a guy that‚Äôs the epitome of what we want to be as a football team in terms of the energy and effort and owning his role. The game‚Äôs never too big for him. He makes big plays for us all the time, not only in the passing game key blocks in the run game. He‚Äôs kind of our enforcer.‚ÄùIn three games, Lazard caught 13-of-16 passes for 254 yards. Among all 122 receivers to be targeted at least 16 times, Lazard ranks fifth with 2.62 yards per target, according to Pro Football Focus.Adams ranks second with 3.11 yards per target. He played through an ankle injury and scored the winning touchdown last week against Jacksonville. The severity of the injury is unknown but, listening to quarterback Aaron Rodgers speak in such admiration after the game on Sunday, it seems the injury is something more than just a minor twist.‚ÄúThe dude‚Äôs a special player,‚Äù Rodgers said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one-of-a-kind and he never ceases to grow my respect. And it‚Äôs just another chapter for him today dealing with what he was dealing with to come back out there and catch a touchdown.

After all, they‚Äôre 7-2 following a 24-20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. Nonetheless, on the heels of a loss to the Minnesota Vikings two weeks ago, the Packers turned in another lethargic performance at home against one of the NFL‚Äôs bottom-feeders.In the absence of the typical 78,000 fans that bring Lambeau Field to life, Rodgers wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing some of the between-series goofiness.‚ÄúI told Matt (LaFleur), I want to see ‚ÄòRoll Out the Barrel.‚Äô I want the beer races. I want ‚ÄòSign, Sign, Everywhere a Sign.‚Äô I want ‚ÄòYMCA,‚Äô‚Äù Rodgers said after the game. ‚ÄúI want the favorites. I don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôre shying away from some of those but, hey, I‚Äôm just one man.‚ÄùNo different than the loss to the Vikings, who were 1-5 at the time, LaFleur lamented the lack of urgency and passion against the Jaguars, who fell to 1-8. Even a question about how his defense rose to the occasion to preserve the victory turned into a dialogue about the lack of emotion.As always, LaFleur pointed the finger first at himself and his coaching staff.‚ÄúI think every player, everybody involved with this team, has got to look deep inside of them and understand and appreciate the opportunity to go out there and compete,‚Äù LaFleur said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs special when you get a chance to go play a football game in the National Football League. And we‚Äôve got to do a better job of bringing more juice, just bringing a tougher mind-set to the gameday ‚Äì especially when we‚Äôre at home. I don‚Äôt know what it is about the last couple games here at Lambeau, but certainly it hasn‚Äôt been our best and we‚Äôve got to be better.‚ÄùGreen Bay dominated the game statistically. It wound up with overwhelming advantages of 395-260 in total yards and 6.6-4.3 in total yards. Rodgers doubled rookie counterpart Jake Luton in passing yards and crushed him by 45.4 points in passer rating.Juice had nothing to do with JK Scott‚Äôs low, line-drive punt that was returned for a touchdown. Juice had nothing to do with Davante Adams‚Äô fumble early in the third quarter, which the Jags turned into the tying touchdown. Juice had nothing to do with Rodgers‚Äô interception late in the third quarter, which the Jags turned into the go-ahead field goal. That‚Äôs 17 of the 20 points allowed. And maybe this juicy conversation would have been tastier had the wind not blown a third-down deep shot to Robert Tonyan out of his reach on the opening possession.Regardless, Green Bay‚Äôs first three possessions ended in punts. Scott didn‚Äôt punt that many times in four of the first eight games. Jacksonville running back James Robinson rushed for 61 yards in the first half.The combination of a slow start and some huge miscues put the Packers on the ropes against one of the worst teams in the NFL.What‚Äôs the problem?‚ÄúIf I knew, it definitely wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, right?‚Äù LaFleur said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got to do some investigating, obviously. And look at myself first. But that wasn‚Äôt good enough, there‚Äôs no doubt about it. In terms of just the energy, the passion, we‚Äôre playing football. These guys are playing a kids game, and getting paid for it, man. It‚Äôs disturbing to me. And it starts with myself and our staff. We‚Äôve got to bring more energy for these guys.‚ÄùNonetheless, the Packers improved to 7-2. With Seattle losing to the Los Angeles Rams, the Packers and Saints are now tied atop the NFC. With Green Bay beating New Orleans in Week 3, LaFleur, Rodgers and the rest of the team went to bed on Sunday as the frontrunner for the No. 1 seed and the conference‚Äôs lone playoff bye.Without fans in Lambeau Field anytime soon to help provide the energy that‚Äôs been lacking, do the Packers have a worthy homefield advantage?‚ÄúObviously, having a loud fan base is important and feeling the energy, especially for the defensive players, is very important,‚Äù Rodgers said. ‚ÄúBut getting warmer weather or dome teams up here in December and January has always been a good advantage for us. We‚Äôve thrown the ball well in bad weather, we‚Äôve won big games in the bad weather. Getting a home game in January, with or without fans ‚Äì hopefully with ‚Äì will definitely be an advantage for us.‚ÄùFollow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

In fact, EdjSports.com, the data science and analytics sports firm that owns Football Outsiders, called it the worst decision of the week and the third-worst of the season.EdjSports weighs critical risk-management decisions with its ‚Äúgame-winning chance‚Äù metric. GWC is a team‚Äôs win probability at any point in the game. It is generated from EdjFootball‚Äôs simulation model, which is rooted in 20-plus years of NFL play-by-play data and popular analytics tools such as DVOA, but customizes it to each team‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses. So, going for it on fourth-and-1 against Jacksonville on Sunday might have a different result than going for it on fourth-and-1 against Indianapolis next week.RELATED: WHAT IS EDJSPORTS.COM? WELL, IT‚ÄôS BACKED BY ZEUS.‚ÄúThis is a model we‚Äôve developed for more of a decade,‚Äù EdjSports founder Frank Frigo said recently. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been rigorously calibrated and tested against a lot of empirical data. We know it‚Äôs very good. At those forks in the road, how much did [a decision] affect win probability?‚Äù‚ÄùOn Sunday, a pair of runs to the right side by Aaron Jones set up a third-and-1, in which Jones was stuffed. The Jaguars called their first timeout with 2:32 remaining.The fork-in-the-road decision for LaFleur: Go for it to get a first down or punt. Had the Packers gotten the first down, the Jaguars still had two timeouts and the 2-minute warning to stop the clock. So, had Green Bay converted the fourth down but failed to move the chains on its next set of downs, it would have punted on the first play after the 2-minute warning.Of course, had the Packers failed to get the first down, the Jaguars would have been 23 yards from the go-ahead touchdown.So, given the risk vs. reward, LaFleur made what seemed to be the logical decision and punted.The data, however, suggests LaFleur made the wrong call. EdjSports.com data analyst Ian O‚ÄôConnor detailed the logic:Green Bay came into the game second in passing and ninth in rushing in our Edj Power Indexes (EPIs), while Jacksonville was 31st against the pass and 22nd against the run. This is a huge advantage for the Packers offense. Defensively, Green Bay was 22nd against the pass and 20th against the run, while Jacksonville was 30th in passing and 25th in rushing. The numbers for the decision are as follows:- Go for it: Green Bay has a GWC of 90.7%.- Punt: Green Bay has a GWC of 72.6%.If Green Bay converts a first down with exactly 1 yard, and assuming Jacksonville uses its second timeout at 2:25, Green Bay‚Äôs win probability goes to 97.0%.If Green Bay fails to convert, assuming they‚Äôre stopped at the line of scrimmage, Green Bay‚Äôs win probability drops to 63.5%. Since we don‚Äôt know the result of the punt prior to the play, we‚Äôll assume a punt that is around JK Scott‚Äôs net average of 37 yards. So, with a punt to Jacksonville‚Äôs 40-yard line, Green Bay has a GWC of 68.5 percent.Risk: 68.5% - 63.5% = 5%Reward: 97.0% - 68.5% = +28.5%Risk-Reward: 5 / (5 + 28.5) = 14.9% Required Success RateIn that scenario, the required success rate is below the 70% expected conversion rate of an average NFL team on fourth-and-1. Considering the matchup between Green Bay‚Äôs offense and Jacksonville‚Äôs defense, Green Bay could realistically be expected to convert at a higher rate than this.It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that if you ‚Äútrust your defense,‚Äù then it‚Äôs worth the risk.For the record, the Packers have converted an 18th-ranked 58.3 percent of the time on their third- and fourth-and-1 plays this season, including 1-of-3 vs. Jacksonville. The Jaguars have allowed a conversion rate of 61.5 percent."

According to a source, the total value of the deal, including this season, is $105.5 million, including incentives. The extension itself is worth $92 million and up to $94 million, meaning an average of $23 million and perhaps as much as $23.5 million.According to NFL Network, it includes a $30 million signing bonus and a total of $30 million in roster bonuses due in March 2021, 2022 and 2023.Clearly, there is prestige with being No. 1 in anything, and that includes No. 1 in contract.‚ÄúYeah, that was something that I‚Äôve been chasing for a while,‚Äù Bakhtiari said after a 24-20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. ‚ÄúHaving the talks with my family, to have that monetary validation for all the work that I‚Äôve put in really meant a lot. That was something that I can hold onto and have that title for the rest of my life. That is something that is special, that I‚Äôve been chasing really ever since I got in the league. I have goals, very lofty, lofty ones. I always wanted to say that I was the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history and today I get to say that.‚ÄùAfter Saturday‚Äôs team meetings, Bakhtiari said he got a call from his agent, Mark Humenik of IHC Sports, telling Bakhtiari they needed to talk.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs either good news or bad news,‚Äù Bakhtiari said.It was good news. Very good news.‚ÄúThe one thing that I had trusted him with,‚Äù Bakhtiari said, ‚Äúand I told him I was going to ask this question before I‚Äôd ever sign was, he needs to be able to confidently say that this contract is deserving for the highest-paid offensive lineman. I remember I explicitly asked him and he told me, ‚ÄòYes, it is.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòOK, then let‚Äôs do it.‚Äô‚ÄùBakhtiari said he signed the contract at 11 p.m. Saturday. He called it a ‚Äúweight lifted off your shoulders‚Äù to sign his second four-year extension since being a fourth-round draft pick in 2013.‚ÄúI‚Äôm really happy for him,‚Äù quarterback and best friend Aaron Rodgers said. ‚ÄúI was privy to some of the conversations that were going on and was wondering where we were going to get to before the end of this year. ‚ÄúObviously, wrapping him up seemed to be of some benefit to the organization long term, best left tackle in the game, future Hall of Famer, probably. Very happy for him. He‚Äôs having a big year, man. He‚Äôs got a great woman he got engaged with and got a long-term extension that pays him the way he deserves to be paid. He‚Äôs having a hell of a year, he‚Äôs a special player and he‚Äôs a great locker room guy. Pretty happy for him.‚ÄùBakhtiari‚Äôs payday came on the eve of his return to the lineup after missing three games with what was called a chest injury. In reality, he said it was a broken rib.As he‚Äôs done throughout his career, Bakhtiari toughed it out.‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this pad little pad thing, had a flap. Rub some dirt on it. I mean, there‚Äôs only so much,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can protect it, but other than that ‚Ä¶ The one thing was to make sure I was safe, and once we were good on that. I mean, you just have to, I‚Äôve got to be able to play and play well. not put myself or anyone else out there in harm. Once we got to that point, we got the green light on both sides, and I was just excited to get back out there. because I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy sitting on the sidelines.‚ÄùSunday‚Äôs victory was part of a big weekend for Bakhtiari, one that will be capped by more than a can of celebratory beer on Sunday night.It will be a well-deserved celebration. Of the 32 starting left tackles, 19 were selected in the first round. Another five went in the second, Bakhtiari is an outlier as a fourth-round pick. The Packers didn‚Äôt necessarily view him as a left tackle coming out of Colorado. But the man who replaced Bryan Bulaga in the starting lineup in his rookie training camp has built himself into an elite performer.Bakhtiari ‚Äúworked himself into an elite left tackle,‚Äù general manager Brian Gutekunst said.Gutekunst visited the Colorado campus during the 2012 season and came away impressed with Bakhtiari‚Äôs play and work ethic on a really bad team.‚ÄúWe really probably had him ranked much higher than actually where we ended up drafting him,‚Äù Gutekunst said. ‚ÄúWe really thought he had a chance to be a good player in the National Football League. Did we know that he was going to become an elite left tackle? I don‚Äôt know if we could have predicted that or we would have taken him a lot sooner.‚ÄùThe Packers signed Bakhtiari to a four-year extension just before the 2016 opener at Jacksonville. And they did it again just before Sunday‚Äôs game against Jacksonville.Asked what he would have told a teenage version of himself had he been told he‚Äôd be the highest-paid lineman in NFL history, Bakhtiari got emotional.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a liar. You can‚Äôt ever have something, you don‚Äôt really know how to measure someone‚Äôs heart, someone‚Äôs passion, someone‚Äôs work ethic, and that teenager wasn‚Äôt the most physically gifted but he had everything else that pushed him to be where he is today.

So, had Green Bay converted the fourth down but failed to move the chains on its next set of downs, it would have punted on the first play after the 2-minute warning.Of course, had the Packers failed to get the first down, the Jaguars would have been 23 yards from the go-ahead touchdown.So, given the risk vs. reward, LaFleur made what seemed to be the logical decision and punted.The data, however, suggests LaFleur made the wrong call. EdjSports.com data analyst Ian O‚ÄôConnor detailed the logic:Green Bay came into the game second in passing and ninth in rushing in our Edj Power Indexes (EPIs), while Jacksonville was 31st against the pass and 22nd against the run. This is a huge advantage for the Packers offense. Defensively, Green Bay was 22nd against the pass and 20th against the run, while Jacksonville was 30th in passing and 25th in rushing. The numbers for the decision are as follows:- Go for it: Green Bay has a GWC of 90.7%.- Punt: Green Bay has a GWC of 72.6%.If Green Bay converts a first down with exactly 1 yard, and assuming Jacksonville uses its second timeout at 2:25, Green Bay‚Äôs win probability goes to 97.0%.If Green Bay fails to convert, assuming they‚Äôre stopped at the line of scrimmage, Green Bay‚Äôs win probability drops to 63.5%. Since we don‚Äôt know the result of the punt prior to the play, we‚Äôll assume a punt that is around JK Scott‚Äôs net average of 37 yards. So, with a punt to Jacksonville‚Äôs 40-yard line, Green Bay has a GWC of 68.5 percent.Risk: 68.5% - 63.5% = 5%Reward: 97.0% - 68.5% = +28.5%Risk-Reward: 5 / (5 + 28.5) = 14.9% Required Success RateIn that scenario, the required success rate is below the 70% expected conversion rate of an average NFL team on fourth-and-1. Considering the matchup between Green Bay‚Äôs offense and Jacksonville‚Äôs defense, Green Bay could realistically be expected to convert at a higher rate than this.It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that if you ‚Äútrust your defense,‚Äù then it‚Äôs worth the risk.For the record, the Packers have converted an 18th-ranked 58.3 percent of the time on their third- and fourth-and-1 plays this season, including 1-of-3 vs. Jacksonville. The Jaguars have allowed a conversion rate of 61.5 percent.As for LaFleur, he said going for it never crossed his mind. The defense rose to the occasion to clinch the victory.‚ÄúI did not consider it at the time. Nope,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd you know, fortunately we were right.

According to a source, the total value of the deal, including this season, is $105.5 million, including incentives. The extension itself is worth $92 million and up to $94 million, meaning an average of $23 million and perhaps as much as $23.5 million.According to NFL Network, it includes a $30 million signing bonus and a total of $30 million in roster bonuses due in March 2021, 2022 and 2023.Clearly, there is prestige with being No. 1 in anything, and that includes No. 1 in contract.‚ÄúYeah, that was something that I‚Äôve been chasing for a while,‚Äù Bakhtiari said after a 24-20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. ‚ÄúHaving the talks with my family, to have that monetary validation for all the work that I‚Äôve put in really meant a lot. That was something that I can hold onto and have that title for the rest of my life. That is something that is special, that I‚Äôve been chasing really ever since I got in the league. I have goals, very lofty, lofty ones. I always wanted to say that I was the highest-paid offensive lineman in NFL history and today I get to say that.‚ÄùAfter Saturday‚Äôs team meetings, Bakhtiari said he got a call from his agent, Mark Humenik of IHC Sports, telling Bakhtiari they needed to talk.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs either good news or bad news,‚Äù Bakhtiari said.It was good news. Very good news.‚ÄúThe one thing that I had trusted him with,‚Äù Bakhtiari said, ‚Äúand I told him I was going to ask this question before I‚Äôd ever sign was, he needs to be able to confidently say that this contract is deserving for the highest-paid offensive lineman. I remember I explicitly asked him and he told me, ‚ÄòYes, it is.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòOK, then let‚Äôs do it.‚Äô‚ÄùBakhtiari said he signed the contract at 11 p.m. Saturday. He called it a ‚Äúweight lifted off your shoulders‚Äù to sign his second four-year extension since being a fourth-round draft pick in 2013.‚ÄúI‚Äôm really happy for him,‚Äù quarterback and best friend Aaron Rodgers said. ‚ÄúI was privy to some of the conversations that were going on and was wondering where we were going to get to before the end of this year. ‚ÄúObviously, wrapping him up seemed to be of some benefit to the organization long term, best left tackle in the game, future Hall of Famer, probably. Very happy for him. He‚Äôs having a big year, man. He‚Äôs got a great woman he got engaged with and got a long-term extension that pays him the way he deserves to be paid. He‚Äôs having a hell of a year, he‚Äôs a special player and he‚Äôs a great locker room guy. Pretty happy for him.‚ÄùBakhtiari‚Äôs payday came on the eve of his return to the lineup after missing three games with what was called a chest injury. In reality, he said it was a broken rib.As he‚Äôs done throughout his career, Bakhtiari toughed it out.‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this pad little pad thing, had a flap. Rub some dirt on it. I mean, there‚Äôs only so much,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can protect it, but other than that ‚Ä¶ The one thing was to make sure I was safe, and once we were good on that. I mean, you just have to, I‚Äôve got to be able to play and play well. not put myself or anyone else out there in harm. Once we got to that point, we got the green light on both sides, and I was just excited to get back out there. because I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy sitting on the sidelines.‚ÄùSunday‚Äôs victory was part of a big weekend for Bakhtiari, one that will be capped by more than a can of celebratory beer on Sunday night.It will be a well-deserved celebration. Of the 32 starting left tackles, 19 were selected in the first round. Another five went in the second, Bakhtiari is an outlier as a fourth-round pick. The Packers didn‚Äôt necessarily view him as a left tackle coming out of Colorado. But the man who replaced Bryan Bulaga in the starting lineup in his rookie training camp has built himself into an elite performer.Bakhtiari ‚Äúworked himself into an elite left tackle,‚Äù general manager Brian Gutekunst said.Gutekunst visited the Colorado campus during the 2012 season and came away impressed with Bakhtiari‚Äôs play and work ethic on a really bad team.‚ÄúWe really probably had him ranked much higher than actually where we ended up drafting him,‚Äù Gutekunst said. ‚ÄúWe really thought he had a chance to be a good player in the National Football League. Did we know that he was going to become an elite left tackle? I don‚Äôt know if we could have predicted that or we would have taken him a lot sooner.‚ÄùThe Packers signed Bakhtiari to a four-year extension just before the 2016 opener at Jacksonville. And they did it again just before Sunday‚Äôs game against Jacksonville.Asked what he would have told a teenage version of himself had he been told he‚Äôd be the highest-paid lineman in NFL history, Bakhtiari got emotional.‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a liar. You can‚Äôt ever have something, you don‚Äôt really know how to measure someone‚Äôs heart, someone‚Äôs passion, someone‚Äôs work ethic, and that teenager wasn‚Äôt the most physically gifted but he had everything else that pushed him to be where he is today. That‚Äôs what I would have looked that teenager in the face and told.‚ÄùFollow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

56,packers,https://www.si.com/nfl/packers/news/4-views-from-inside-the-colts,Four Days to Kickoff: 4 Views from Inside the Colts,"Bill HuberGREEN BAY, Wis. ‚Äì The Green Bay Packers (7-2) play at the Indianapolis Colts (6-3) in a big showdown at 3:25 p.m. Sunday. Let‚Äôs get to know the foe with Phillip B. Wilson of Sports Illustrated‚Äôs All Colts.1. Philip Rivers has destroyed the Packers in his four starts, averaging about 375 yards per game. Obviously, Rivers is getting up there in years and he doesn‚Äôt throw it like he did once upon a time, but how has he played and how has he fit this season? And as a follow-up, who has stood out, if anyone, from a tightly packed group of pass catchers?When Rivers doesn‚Äôt throw an interception, the Colts are 4-0. That‚Äôs when he‚Äôs efficient, spreading the ball around and resisting the temptation to take risks. In the other games, when the Colts are 2-3, he has five TDs and seven interceptions. He still throws the inexplicable interception, most notably an incredibly bad pick-six at Cleveland in which the receiver wasn‚Äôt open and the ball seemed like it was thrown to the defender.The Colts are coming off their best win at Tennessee, in which they utilized Rivers‚Äô smarts in the no-huddle to exploit a Titans defense that has allowed yards in chunks and failed to generate a pass rush. Rivers gets rid of the ball quickly out of necessity because he‚Äôs immobile. That means defenses try to crowd the box to limit the short dump-off passes to running backs. The Colts have struggled to stretch the field and haven‚Äôt been good on third down and in the red zone, so it‚Äôs fair to question if Rivers was worth $25 million. If he gets the Colts to the playoffs, perhaps that answer is yes, but at 38 and in his 17th season, it sure doesn‚Äôt seem like he would be worth another year at that price. The Colts and Rivers have expressed the hope this marriage would last for at least another year.Wide receiver T.Y. Hilton is no longer the four-time Pro Bowl star most remember, although he has drawn seven penalties for 71 yards, so he can still get open with his route-running and force defenders to grab him. But because he‚Äôs not the No. 1 speed threat of the past, the Colts quickly resorted to using several different receivers. Rookie Michael Pittman Jr., a second-round choice, looks like the most talented. Although he missed three games due to surgery for leg compartment syndrome, he had his best game with seven catches for 101 yards as well as a 21-yard rush against the Titans. He‚Äôs a big target that Rivers likes, and has the size and speed to either elude defenders or run over them.Zach Pascal leads the wide receivers with 28 receptions, and he quietly goes unnoticed, but he‚Äôs reliable and, like Pittman, is an excellent blocker outside. The fact that running back Nyheim Hines has a team-high 33 receptions speaks to how the Colts use those checkdown or dump-off throws like runs because the rushing game hasn‚Äôt been as productive as last year. Tight end Mo Alie-Cox has also emerged as a capable playmaker, although he doesn‚Äôt get as many touches as he should.2. Jonathan Taylor will forever be a legend in Wisconsin. In my 30-some years of really watching football, there are two players who you just felt could go the distance every time he touched the football. One was Adrian Peterson with the Vikings. The other was Taylor with the Badgers. However, he‚Äôs played less and less as his rookie season has progressed. Can you give us a midseason report card on Taylor? Is there a sense of disappointment?Thrust into the starting role after the Colts lost Marlon Mack for the season in the second quarter of Week 1, Taylor has shown flashes of potential. The Colts won‚Äôt say it, but they expect to see more. He has 428 rushing yards and averages 3.8 yards per carry with four TDs, and he‚Äôs added 22 catches for 203 yards. But the Colts sure haven‚Äôt treated him like a starter lately. Despite a promising start against Baltimore two games ago, his first lost fumble in the NFL was returned for a tying touchdown and got him benched. In the last three games, he has 24 carries for 61 yards. A lot of those were in predictable run situations with the box stacked.The Colts have said they stuck with the hot hand with Jordan Wilkins at Detroit and Hines at Tennessee, but Taylor is the best rusher on this roster. Some are quick to criticize his lack of production, but again, the Colts haven‚Äôt put him in ideal situations too many times. This team has struggled in short yardage, regardless of who runs the ball. At some point, Taylor is going to prove he‚Äôs worthy of more touches and have the kind of game that reminds everyone why he was drafted in the second round. He‚Äôs hard on himself, but shouldn‚Äôt shoulder the blame for the Colts being among the worst in rush yards per carry.3. The offensive line is supposed to be great. And to be sure, defenses have hardly laid a finger on Rivers. But the run game hasn‚Äôt really gotten going. What‚Äôs the story? That‚Äôs a big question because Green Bay‚Äôs run defense isn‚Äôt good.The Colts adopted the ‚ÄúRun The Damn Ball‚Äù mantra last year, and it worked as the offense finished seventh in rushing yards, despite having a limited quarterback who didn‚Äôt throw the ball down the field. That still didn‚Äôt matter because the O-line was solid. A year later, with that line returning intact, it hasn‚Äôt been even remotely the same. Part of it is predictable play-calling, with too many runs in key situations designed to just follow All-Pro left guard Quenton Nelson and Pro Bowl center Ryan Kelly. Defensive coordinators expect it, and those plays get stuffed too often.But perhaps the more revealing explanation is Rivers. Because the Colts have a quarterback who can‚Äôt move, a greater emphasis was placed on pass protection. As a result, the Colts lead the NFL in fewest sacks allowed. But the run blocking has suffered. Coach Frank Reich, who calls the plays, insists that running the ball is still this team‚Äôs identity. But based on the statistics and what he‚Äôs called, it‚Äôs obvious the Colts must pass more to set up the run. That means they don‚Äôt run the ball as much, nor is it as effective.4. Defensively, Indianapolis is only No. 1 in yards allowed per carry and No. 1 in opponent passer rating. And yet, other than Darius Leonard and Xavier Rhodes, there‚Äôs really not anyone on the unit that a casual Packers fan would recognize. Can you give us two or three keys to the success of what will be the best defense the Packers have faced this season?The No. 1 key to this significant defensive improvement has been the March acquisition of All-Pro defensive tackle DeForest Buckner. As a disruptive three-technique defender, he leads the team in quarterback hits and demands so much attention that linebackers Darius Leonard and Bobby Okereke are freed up to make more plays. Teams that don‚Äôt double Buckner pay for it.His position is vital to a triangle scheme that coordinator Matt Eberflus employs, which relies upon three key playmakers in Buckner, Leonard, and nickel cornerback Kenny Moore II. The Colts have lacked a player like Buckner on the D-line to make this work until now. The Colts have 11 interceptions largely because they‚Äôve put enough pressure on quarterbacks to force mistakes. This team has been inconsistent in sacks, but pressures/hits have been the key in most games.5 Days: Five Keys to the GameFollow along all day for updates from Lambeau Field.

The defense delivered two stops to save the day.‚ÄúWe had to get the win,‚Äù safety Adrian Amos said. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt always in situations where we wanted to be. Those are the types of games where the defense has got to show up and make those stops.‚ÄùOn the first of those stops, the Jaguars marched from their 7 to midfield before the defense forced three consecutive incompletions ‚Äì including breakups by backups Ka‚Äôdar Hollman on second down and Raven Greene on third down.Jacksonville punted with 4 minutes to go. Green Bay‚Äôs offense, which moved the ball in fits and starts all day, couldn‚Äôt get a single first down, let alone run out the clock. JK Scott‚Äôs punt into a stiff breeze went only 30 yards, so Jacksonville took over at its 49 with 2:32 remaining.Jacksonville got one first down to reach Green Bay‚Äôs 36 before the Packers slammed the door. On second-and-10, Gary sacked quarterback Jake Luton. On third down, Gary and Kenny Clark provided the pressure and Preston Smith sacked Luton. On fourth-and-26, Za‚ÄôDarius Smith got the initial pressure and Gary came in late to force a desperation throw to the sideline that was incomplete to end the game.No different than last week, it‚Äôs easy to put an asterisk on Green Bay‚Äôs defensive performance. The Jaguars have lost eight consecutive games and have one of the worst offenses in the NFL. They‚Äôre being led by a rookie quarterback, Jake Luton, who was making his second professional start.But the Packers, playing without starting cornerbacks Jaire Alexander and Kevin King, mostly took care of business. While rookie running back James Robinson found too much running room against Green Bay‚Äôs less-than-stout run defense, the final tail of the tape was impressive. The Jaguars gained only 260 yards and went 4-of-13 on third down. Luton was only 18-of-35 passing and was intercepted by Amos, and star receiver D.J. Chark managed just four catches for 56 yards. Of the 20 points, seven were supplied on a punt return and another seven came on a 16-yard drive courtesy of an Adams fumble.‚ÄúWe made the plays when we had to today,‚Äù Amos said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve just got to build on this.‚ÄùIt was Gary making those plays with the game on the line. For all the hype about Gary‚Äôs work ethic and talent, he entered the game with only 1.5 sacks and 11 tackles.‚ÄúI just think it‚Äôs just a step in the right direction,‚Äù coach Matt LaFleur said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got to continue to progress and get better and better and better, and we‚Äôve got to make sure that he gets those opportunities. Certainly, he had a big impact at the end of the game.‚ÄùCould you try and get Mike P to explain how he determines who he wants on the field on DL at various points in the game?EditorSure.

59,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/beardigest-plus/how-bears-can-best-activate-their-running-attack,How Bears Can Best Activate Their Running Attack,"Gene Chamberlainan hour agoThe Bears are going into the NFL's version of a think tank, a self-scout during the bye week.They have to find answers after their offense has plummeted so far that they're better only than the offense of Adam Gase, Dowell Loggains and the last-ranked Jets. This isn't good company to keep for a team supposedly coached by an offensive genius.Just like in 2019, the Chicago Bears have now suffered a four-game midseason losing streak after a 19-13 defeat by the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football, one made worse by the loss of quarterback Nick Foles to a leg/hip injury.Gene ChamberlainNov 17, 202015 hours agobyGene ChamberlainThe Bill Lazor Experiment Wasn't a Success Even if It ContinuesGene Chamberlaina day agoAn injury to Nick Foles isn't as severe as anticipated but Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy says he's leaving everything on the table at this point regarding the quarterbacks and the offense as they head to a bye week.Gene Chamberlaina day agoThe Chicago Bears offense was a prime-time embarrassment as they failed to support their defense and special teams in a 19-13 loss to Minnesota.Gene ChamberlainNov 18, 2020The Chicago Bears squandered Cordrarrelle Patterson's record-tying and record-breaking touchdown return of 104 yards in their fourth straight defeat.Gene ChamberlainNov 18, 2020Here's How SI Sees Monday Night with VikingsGene ChamberlainNov 17, 2020Nov 17, 2020byGene ChamberlainThe Chicago Bears could have two veteran starters on the offensive line who didn't play last week as starting center Cody Whitehair has been activated from the Reserve/COVID-19 list and Eric Kush has also been activated after rejoining the team last week following a year in Cleveland.Gene ChamberlainNov 17, 2020Bill Lazor has had some success and some failure calling plays in the NFL but this will be the first time he's tried to do it with a defense of this caliber backing up his offensive efforts.Gene ChamberlainNov 17, 2020"
60,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/vikings-deal-bears-fourth-straight-defeat#comments,Frustrated Bears Get Nick Foles Hurt in 19-13 Loss to Vikings,"Gene ChamberlainThe Bears had injuries added to insult, and as a result are not only 5-5 on the year but are heading off into their bye week and possibly NFL oblivion.The worst offensive peformance since Dec. 3, 2017 produced a 19-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, and in the process they lost both quarterback Nick Foles and defensive end Akiem Hicks, two of their most indispensable players.The Bears had 149 yards, their worst total under Matt Nagy, and had four second-half three-and-outs when the game was there for the taking, after a team record 104-yard kick return touchdown by Cordarrelle Patterson staked them to a 13-7 lead.""Obviously we struggled mightily on offense in having the four three-and-outs in the second half,"" Nagy said. ""We had field position, we couldn't convert on that in the red zone.""It overshadows how well I thought our defense played and the different sudden changes they had, how well our special teams played. I was proud of those guys. So two out of the three parts right now are playing well. It‚Äôs been a constant theme for us.""The new part is the injury to Foles, who was in obvious pain after a near sack when he threw away the ball and Minnesota's Ifeadi Odenigbo in turn threw him on his right shoulder.The injury in the final minute of the game cast a shadow over the remainder of the season.""It was his leg or his hip,"" Nagy said. ""So I think they're still working through the details on that. I have not talked to him yet in the locker room. I will here after we're done and just make sure he's OK. I know he's upset. It's been frustrating, it's been hard, and that's the part that's difficult through all this because no one wants it more than him to be out there to fight with his teammates.""Foles completed 15 of 26 for 106 yards and was sacked twice, but Bears passers were hit 11 times while throwing.""We've got to just keep using that persistence over resistance and just keep fighting and keep staying together and eventually something here will hopefully change and I think that‚Äôs where we‚Äôve got to believe and trust and keep playing for each other,"" Nagy said.On the positive side was Patterson's kick return touchdown, straight up the right side . Once he picked his spot, he burst through almost untouched to start the second half and deliver a 13-7 lead after Cairo Santos had made first-half field goals of 23 and 42 yards.That was it, though, for Bears scoring. The offense looked like it went into the bye week about two quarters earlier than the defense and special teams.The Bears had two second-half first downs, one on the final desperation drive with less than a minute left and no timeouts‚Äîa drive that ended with Tyler Bray at quarterback because of Foles' injury.""We're not good enough right now,"" Patterson said of the offense. ""Everybody sees that. It's no secret the offense isn't good enough.""Just have to keep stepping up, just playing better because the defense, they're playing lights out each and every week. They're setting us up each and every time to score points and get the win, but we're just not coming out at the top. This bye week is going to be real critical for a lot of people to get healthy and just stay focused on the right thing and just staying healthy, like I said.""Patterson's return broke Gale Sayers' record of 103 yards set in 1967 against Pittsburgh, and it tied him for the NFL record of eight career kick return touchdowns.""Honestly, I've just gotta give it up to those 10 guys that was blocking for me,"" Patterson said. ""Man, they did a heck of a job. We work it every week, man, every week at practice. Every time we get the ball, we want to go out on kickoff return and score.""The trouble is they have to do this because the offense can't score. It's the second time in four weeks they failed to score a touchdown on offense in a game.They went 2 of 11 on third downs after going 2 of 15 the previous week, and this was against a beaten-up Vikings defense. Then they got Foles injured.""Pissed off, disappointment, a lot of emotions, negative emotions right now,"" tackle Charles Leno Jr. said. ""We've got to process. We know it's two Monday nights we didn't perform well. It's just frustrating.""The defense didn't play perfect, lost Hicks to a hamstring injury late, but did produce a Khalil Mack interception and return to set up a wasted scoring opportunity. They also had a fumble recovery by Tashaun Gipson on Minnesota's first drive.The Bears allowed Dan Bailey field goals of 37 and 43 yards in the third quarter to tie, but one of those came after punt returner Dwayne Harris muffed a punt at the Bears 20.The winning touchdown was a 6-yarder to Adam Thielen from Kirk Cousins, who finally got his first Monday Night Football win on his 10th try. It came with 10:06 left, but it could have been 10 days left for all the better the Bears offense has been of late.Cousins completed 25 of 36 for 292 yards and also threw a 17-yard TD pass in the first quarter to Thielen, a one-handed grab.""They were just, like, finding soft spots and they did what they had to do,"" linebacker Roquan Smith said.

64,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/what-bears-can-expect-from-bill-lazor,What Bears Can Expect from Bill Lazor the Play Caller,"Gene ChamberlainIf the Bears can know understand anything from their new play caller's past, it's he cannot work miracles alone.Bill Lazor at least is honest.""I can think back to University of Buffalo, 2001, 2002, we would do anything for a first down,"" Lazor said. Right? Hopefully I've come a long way since then.""Lazor's career calling plays has taken a journey through success and failure at college and pro levels. Either simply seemed to depend greatly on the team.  As he pointed out this weekk: ""Oh, I think every team is a little bit different.""Lazor had three seasons and 14 games as a play caller in the NFL, two seasons with Ryan Tannehill as quarterback in Miami and a season and 14 games with Andy Dalton as quarterback in Cincinnati.So many other factors came into play with each team that it's difficult to pin all the blame on Lazor's play calling or give him credit for a lot. What is apparent is he knows how important it is to balance the pass and run.What's also apparent is he's never been backed by a top-level defense like the Bears have now. So it will be interesting to see how he can play to his team's strength and make for better complementary play between offense, defense and special teams.In past stops, Lazor attempted to achieve balance. He couldn't always do it based on  how effective his talent was, or on how poor his team's defense was. The complementary football wasn't always there. His teams' defenses failed at times, and he couldn't stick with the run.He also showed he could elevate talent somewhat but only to a marginal extent.With Miami, it was Tannehill's third and fourth seasons and he was a late bloomer who really took a huge step when he had a running game for support in Tennessee.The Dolphins in coach Joe Philbin's first year had the No. 14 offense, 17th ranked passing and 12th ranked rushing game. This was with Lazor as coordinator. He had current Bears running back Lamar Miller gain a career-high 1,099 yards rushing, as well as Daniel Thomas and Knowshon Moreno as support backs.The next year they finished 26th on offense, 19th passing and 23rd rushing when they were last in rushing attempts. Their own defense had declined from 12th in the league to 25th, which makes it more difficult to keep up rushing totals on offense. The entire thing started caving in and the staff was replaced after two years.When Lazor when to the Bengals, he was a quarterbacks coach until Ken Zampese's offense short-circuited after just two weeks of the 2017 season. The Bengals fired Zampese after they scored nine points total in two home games, making them the first NFL team since the Eagles of 1939 to open the first two games at home without a touchdown.Lazor's offense showed an immediate uptick after Zampese was launched, but it lasted only a short period and part of this resulted from playing two defenses -- Green Bay and Buffalo -- which struggled through much of the year.The Bengals had managed only 221 and 295 yards in the first two losses. Under Lazor they immediately went over 300 yards for three straight weeks and scored 24, 31 and 20 points. Then it turned south again. Lazor's offense averaged 18.7 points and 266 yards over the final 14 games. That was only 8 yards more than they'd averaged the first two games under Zampese.They scored only seven points against Vic Fangio's Bears defense in John Fox's last season in a Week 13 33-7 loss. The next week they got one TD against Mike Zimmer's Vikings and lost 34-7.The next year they averaged almost 20 more yards rushing but still struggled and were 26th on offense. In both years at Cincinnati under head coach Marvin Lewis, the defense fell off greatly. It didn't help support the offense. They finished 30th defending the run 2017 and last overall on defense in 2018.The big Bears goals now will be to score early, and score in the third quarter. The Bears have seven points in nine third quarters.They really only had first-half leads to protect to any degree in the wins over the Giants and Panthers. Beyond that, it's been an uphill struggle each week as they've failed to support their defense.Now it's Lazor's chance to try and breathe some life into a carcass.""Is it going to perfect? No. Is every call going to be great? No,"" Nagy said. ""But that's OK, and we'll work through that. And I am going to be the biggest supporter of my coaches that I have on staff because I believe in them and I trust in them.""Considering how the Bears have gone from 21st in Nagy's first year on offense, to 29th last year and stand 30th going into Monday night's game, it is easy to see why he made the decision.Whether it can achieve anything considering the lack of talent and offensive line injuries remains to be seen.Twitter: BearDigest@BearsOnMavenIt's not a simple one-step procedure for the Chicago Bears to find a running attack in the final six games but it has to be done or they not only can forget about the playoffs, but they might be putting coaching jobs and personnel jobs in jeopardyGene ChamberlainJust like in 2019, the Chicago Bears have now suffered a four-game midseason losing streak after a 19-13 defeat by the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football, one made worse by the loss of quarterback Nick Foles to a leg/hip injury.Gene ChamberlainbyGene ChamberlainThe Bill Lazor Experiment Wasn't a Success Even if It ContinuesGene ChamberlainAn injury to Nick Foles isn't as severe as anticipated but Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy says he's leaving everything on the table at this point regarding the quarterbacks and the offense as they head to a bye week.Gene ChamberlainThe Chicago Bears offense was a prime-time embarrassment as they failed to support their defense and special teams in a 19-13 loss to Minnesota.Gene ChamberlainThe Chicago Bears squandered Cordrarrelle Patterson's record-tying and record-breaking touchdown return of 104 yards in their fourth straight defeat.Gene ChamberlainHere's How SI Sees Monday Night with VikingsGene ChamberlainbyGene ChamberlainThe Chicago Bears could have two veteran starters on the offensive line who didn't play last week as starting center Cody Whitehair has been activated from the Reserve/COVID-19 list and Eric Kush has also been activated after rejoining the team last week following a year in Cleveland."

Whitehair has been on there for almost two weeks, and he also had a calf injury which had forced him to leave the game with the Rams late three weeks ago.If Whitehair is able to start, the Bears also could have another veteran lineman playing because they have activated Eric Kush from the practice squad to the roster, along with running back Lamar Miller.This would be Miller's first NFL action since August, 2019, when he suffered a torn ACL while with Houston.  Alex Bars is starting at left guard alongside Whitehair with the first team, so Kush would appear to be slated for backup duties.Kush last started for the Bears in the 2018 season. He started the first seven games that season before a neck injury and last year played for Cleveland.Mario Edwards will start at right defensive end with the season-ending injury to Roy Robertson-Harris. Bilal Nichols is at starting nose tackle.They have also elevated quarterback Tyler Bray as a COVID-19 replacement. Reserve lineman Lachavious Simmons is still on Reserve/COVID-19 and Bray is needed on the 53-man roster because Mitchell Trubisky has been ruled out for Monday's game due to a right shoulder injury.Also, nose tackle Daniel McCullers was promoted to the 53-man roster from the practice squad.

""We had field position, we couldn't convert on that in the red zone.""It overshadows how well I thought our defense played and the different sudden changes they had, how well our special teams played. I was proud of those guys. So two out of the three parts right now are playing well. It‚Äôs been a constant theme for us.""The new part is the injury to Foles, who was in obvious pain after a near sack when he threw away the ball and Minnesota's Ifeadi Odenigbo in turn threw him on his right shoulder.The injury in the final minute of the game cast a shadow over the remainder of the season.""It was his leg or his hip,"" Nagy said. ""So I think they're still working through the details on that. I have not talked to him yet in the locker room. I will here after we're done and just make sure he's OK. I know he's upset. It's been frustrating, it's been hard, and that's the part that's difficult through all this because no one wants it more than him to be out there to fight with his teammates.""Foles completed 15 of 26 for 106 yards and was sacked twice, but Bears passers were hit 11 times while throwing.""We've got to just keep using that persistence over resistance and just keep fighting and keep staying together and eventually something here will hopefully change and I think that‚Äôs where we‚Äôve got to believe and trust and keep playing for each other,"" Nagy said.On the positive side was Patterson's kick return touchdown, straight up the right side . Once he picked his spot, he burst through almost untouched to start the second half and deliver a 13-7 lead after Cairo Santos had made first-half field goals of 23 and 42 yards.That was it, though, for Bears scoring. The offense looked like it went into the bye week about two quarters earlier than the defense and special teams.The Bears had two second-half first downs, one on the final desperation drive with less than a minute left and no timeouts‚Äîa drive that ended with Tyler Bray at quarterback because of Foles' injury.""We're not good enough right now,"" Patterson said of the offense. ""Everybody sees that. It's no secret the offense isn't good enough.""Just have to keep stepping up, just playing better because the defense, they're playing lights out each and every week. They're setting us up each and every time to score points and get the win, but we're just not coming out at the top. This bye week is going to be real critical for a lot of people to get healthy and just stay focused on the right thing and just staying healthy, like I said.""Patterson's return broke Gale Sayers' record of 103 yards set in 1967 against Pittsburgh, and it tied him for the NFL record of eight career kick return touchdowns.""Honestly, I've just gotta give it up to those 10 guys that was blocking for me,"" Patterson said. ""Man, they did a heck of a job. We work it every week, man, every week at practice. Every time we get the ball, we want to go out on kickoff return and score.""The trouble is they have to do this because the offense can't score. It's the second time in four weeks they failed to score a touchdown on offense in a game.They went 2 of 11 on third downs after going 2 of 15 the previous week, and this was against a beaten-up Vikings defense. Then they got Foles injured.""Pissed off, disappointment, a lot of emotions, negative emotions right now,"" tackle Charles Leno Jr. said. ""We've got to process. We know it's two Monday nights we didn't perform well. It's just frustrating.""The defense didn't play perfect, lost Hicks to a hamstring injury late, but did produce a Khalil Mack interception and return to set up a wasted scoring opportunity. They also had a fumble recovery by Tashaun Gipson on Minnesota's first drive.The Bears allowed Dan Bailey field goals of 37 and 43 yards in the third quarter to tie, but one of those came after punt returner Dwayne Harris muffed a punt at the Bears 20.The winning touchdown was a 6-yarder to Adam Thielen from Kirk Cousins, who finally got his first Monday Night Football win on his 10th try. It came with 10:06 left, but it could have been 10 days left for all the better the Bears offense has been of late.Cousins completed 25 of 36 for 292 yards and also threw a 17-yard TD pass in the first quarter to Thielen, a one-handed grab.""They were just, like, finding soft spots and they did what they had to do,"" linebacker Roquan Smith said. ""It was good plays, good plays on their behalf. Can't hang our heads on that. We just have to go to the next play and can't dwell on the past at the end of the day.""There's not much to dwell on in the past, especially on offense, and especially over the past four weeks.Twitter: BearDigest@BearsOnMaven EditorNot happening, although it wouldn't be shocking if some of them sold off to others or to current board membersDownright laughable.

77,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/vikings-deal-bears-fourth-straight-defeat,Frustrated Bears Get Nick Foles Hurt in 19-13 Loss to Vikings,"Gene ChamberlainThe Bears had injuries added to insult, and as a result are not only 5-5 on the year but are heading off into their bye week and possibly NFL oblivion.The worst offensive peformance since Dec. 3, 2017 produced a 19-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, and in the process they lost both quarterback Nick Foles and defensive end Akiem Hicks, two of their most indispensable players.The Bears had 149 yards, their worst total under Matt Nagy, and had four second-half three-and-outs when the game was there for the taking, after a team record 104-yard kick return touchdown by Cordarrelle Patterson staked them to a 13-7 lead.""Obviously we struggled mightily on offense in having the four three-and-outs in the second half,"" Nagy said. ""We had field position, we couldn't convert on that in the red zone.""It overshadows how well I thought our defense played and the different sudden changes they had, how well our special teams played. I was proud of those guys. So two out of the three parts right now are playing well. It‚Äôs been a constant theme for us.""The new part is the injury to Foles, who was in obvious pain after a near sack when he threw away the ball and Minnesota's Ifeadi Odenigbo in turn threw him on his right shoulder.The injury in the final minute of the game cast a shadow over the remainder of the season.""It was his leg or his hip,"" Nagy said. ""So I think they're still working through the details on that. I have not talked to him yet in the locker room. I will here after we're done and just make sure he's OK. I know he's upset. It's been frustrating, it's been hard, and that's the part that's difficult through all this because no one wants it more than him to be out there to fight with his teammates.""Foles completed 15 of 26 for 106 yards and was sacked twice, but Bears passers were hit 11 times while throwing.""We've got to just keep using that persistence over resistance and just keep fighting and keep staying together and eventually something here will hopefully change and I think that‚Äôs where we‚Äôve got to believe and trust and keep playing for each other,"" Nagy said.On the positive side was Patterson's kick return touchdown, straight up the right side . Once he picked his spot, he burst through almost untouched to start the second half and deliver a 13-7 lead after Cairo Santos had made first-half field goals of 23 and 42 yards.That was it, though, for Bears scoring. The offense looked like it went into the bye week about two quarters earlier than the defense and special teams.The Bears had two second-half first downs, one on the final desperation drive with less than a minute left and no timeouts‚Äîa drive that ended with Tyler Bray at quarterback because of Foles' injury.""We're not good enough right now,"" Patterson said of the offense. ""Everybody sees that. It's no secret the offense isn't good enough.""Just have to keep stepping up, just playing better because the defense, they're playing lights out each and every week. They're setting us up each and every time to score points and get the win, but we're just not coming out at the top. This bye week is going to be real critical for a lot of people to get healthy and just stay focused on the right thing and just staying healthy, like I said.""Patterson's return broke Gale Sayers' record of 103 yards set in 1967 against Pittsburgh, and it tied him for the NFL record of eight career kick return touchdowns.""Honestly, I've just gotta give it up to those 10 guys that was blocking for me,"" Patterson said. ""Man, they did a heck of a job. We work it every week, man, every week at practice. Every time we get the ball, we want to go out on kickoff return and score.""The trouble is they have to do this because the offense can't score. It's the second time in four weeks they failed to score a touchdown on offense in a game.They went 2 of 11 on third downs after going 2 of 15 the previous week, and this was against a beaten-up Vikings defense. Then they got Foles injured."

80,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/bears-report-card-for-prime-time-embarrassment,Bears Report Card: Even the Empty Seats Wanted to Boo,"Gene ChamberlainIf not for the Soldier Field seats being empty Monday night, they would have been booed off the field.As it was, a few security and janitoral crew members standing at the back of the stadium's lower bowl booed and heckled.It seemed sufficient.The Bears embarrassed themselves on national TV with an effort so inept on offense it could have been from the John Fox or Abe Gibron coaching eras.The loss to the Vikings featured the worst yardage effort by the offense in the Matt Nagy era.They had 149 yards of offense, fewest since Fox's team had 147 yards on Dec. 3, 2017 with Mitchell Trubisky at quarterback in a 15-14 loss to Robbie Gould and the San Francisco 49ers.Here are the one-sided grades from Monday night for a team which might be better if it simply quick-kicked on first down each possession.Running game: FThey actually had center Cody Whitehair back from a calf injury and COVID-19 to help their blocking, but between backs Patterson, Ryan Nall, Artavis Pierce and Lamar Miller all they could manage was 41 yards rushing and one rushing first down. They only had fewer rushing first downs in seven games over their 101 seasons.Passing game: FThe Vikings played their safeties to prevent strikes downfield and Nick Foles had little time to look past his primary target on third downs. The Bears were 2 for 11 on third down, and the pass rush eventually got to Foles so much they knocked him out of the game. They had two first downs in the second half of the game.Run Defense: BKnowing Dalvin Cook was getting the ball, the Bears kept him in check. They limited the Vikings to 99 rushing yards on 33 carries, a 3.0-yard average. That should be sufficient to win a game against a team not known for passing. They shut off the cutback run and even when Akiem Hicks went out with a hamstring injury late in the game they were able to at least slow the running attack sufficiently. Roquan Smith made 14 tackles, including eight solos.Pass Defense: B-The Vikings held the pass rush in check with a blend of quick passes and play-action throws or bootleg passes but still the Bears found ways to turn the ball over to their offense with a Khalil Mack interception and Tashaun Gipson's fumble recovery on a pass play. Considering how their own offense had four second-half three-and-outs and could manage only 10:52 of possession time, it's amazing the Vikings scored only 19 points.Special Teams: A-Cordarrelle Patterson's 104-yard touchdown return would have made for a near-perfect day but Dwayne Harris muffed a punt in a game when he suffered a tricep injury. The muff cost them three points, which proved huge in the late part of the game as they did reach the Minnesota 30 and could have tried a tying field goal then. Cairo Santos made his 13th and 14th straight field goals, Anthony Miller broke the team's longest punt return of the year, 34 yards, and punter Patrick O'Donnell enjoyed another strong game.Coaching: FMatt Nagy's coaching blunder of the night was going for a first down from the Vikings 35 on fourth down with just over two minutes left. If Santos kicks a field goal, they have all their timeouts left and a chance to either tie or win if they get the ball back. He put no faith in his defense again, only in an offense which produced two second-half first downs. Sure it was a 52- or 53-yard try, but Santos had made 14 straight. The game plan of Bill Lazor had a little more variety of depth to the pass plays initially, at least until they started falling behind. Still, there seems to be way too much of an attempt early in games by the offensive braintrust to set up plays for later rather than simply getting to the end zone regardless of how they do it. No sense setting anything up when you can't get there later or at all anyway. The Bears averaged 4.07 yards per pass attempt. That can't be all execution. There has to be scheme issues involved, as well, when the figure is that low.Overall: D-The Bears had only four plays that went for longer than a 9-yard gain, indicating an offensive game plan rather low in deception or imagination. They averaged 3.0 yards a play, or 108 inches, and produced a season-low 10 first downs. The sad part was their 41 rushing yards weren't even a season low. In fact, they went lower than that twice. Only Patterson's return and the way the defense scrapped to get two turnovers kept this from being a complete debacle.Twitter: BearDigest@BearsOnMavenIt's not a simple one-step procedure for the Chicago Bears to find a running attack in the final six games but it has to be done or they not only can forget about the playoffs, but they might be putting coaching jobs and personnel jobs in jeopardyGene ChamberlainJust like in 2019, the Chicago Bears have now suffered a four-game midseason losing streak after a 19-13 defeat by the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football, one made worse by the loss of quarterback Nick Foles to a leg/hip injury.Gene ChamberlainbyGene ChamberlainThe Bill Lazor Experiment Wasn't a Success Even if It ContinuesGene Chamberlain"
81,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/what-bears-can-expect-from-bill-lazor,What Bears Can Expect from Bill Lazor the Play Caller,"Gene ChamberlainIf the Bears can know understand anything from their new play caller's past, it's he cannot work miracles alone.Bill Lazor at least is honest.""I can think back to University of Buffalo, 2001, 2002, we would do anything for a first down,"" Lazor said. Right? Hopefully I've come a long way since then.""Lazor's career calling plays has taken a journey through success and failure at college and pro levels. Either simply seemed to depend greatly on the team.  As he pointed out this weekk: ""Oh, I think every team is a little bit different.""Lazor had three seasons and 14 games as a play caller in the NFL, two seasons with Ryan Tannehill as quarterback in Miami and a season and 14 games with Andy Dalton as quarterback in Cincinnati.So many other factors came into play with each team that it's difficult to pin all the blame on Lazor's play calling or give him credit for a lot. What is apparent is he knows how important it is to balance the pass and run.What's also apparent is he's never been backed by a top-level defense like the Bears have now. So it will be interesting to see how he can play to his team's strength and make for better complementary play between offense, defense and special teams.In past stops, Lazor attempted to achieve balance. He couldn't always do it based on  how effective his talent was, or on how poor his team's defense was. The complementary football wasn't always there. His teams' defenses failed at times, and he couldn't stick with the run.He also showed he could elevate talent somewhat but only to a marginal extent.With Miami, it was Tannehill's third and fourth seasons and he was a late bloomer who really took a huge step when he had a running game for support in Tennessee.The Dolphins in coach Joe Philbin's first year had the No. 14 offense, 17th ranked passing and 12th ranked rushing game. This was with Lazor as coordinator. He had current Bears running back Lamar Miller gain a career-high 1,099 yards rushing, as well as Daniel Thomas and Knowshon Moreno as support backs.The next year they finished 26th on offense, 19th passing and 23rd rushing when they were last in rushing attempts. Their own defense had declined from 12th in the league to 25th, which makes it more difficult to keep up rushing totals on offense. The entire thing started caving in and the staff was replaced after two years.When Lazor when to the Bengals, he was a quarterbacks coach until Ken Zampese's offense short-circuited after just two weeks of the 2017 season. The Bengals fired Zampese after they scored nine points total in two home games, making them the first NFL team since the Eagles of 1939 to open the first two games at home without a touchdown.Lazor's offense showed an immediate uptick after Zampese was launched, but it lasted only a short period and part of this resulted from playing two defenses -- Green Bay and Buffalo -- which struggled through much of the year.The Bengals had managed only 221 and 295 yards in the first two losses. Under Lazor they immediately went over 300 yards for three straight weeks and scored 24, 31 and 20 points. Then it turned south again. Lazor's offense averaged 18.7 points and 266 yards over the final 14 games. That was only 8 yards more than they'd averaged the first two games under Zampese.They scored only seven points against Vic Fangio's Bears defense in John Fox's last season in a Week 13 33-7 loss. The next week they got one TD against Mike Zimmer's Vikings and lost 34-7.The next year they averaged almost 20 more yards rushing but still struggled and were 26th on offense. In both years at Cincinnati under head coach Marvin Lewis, the defense fell off greatly. It didn't help support the offense. They finished 30th defending the run 2017 and last overall on defense in 2018.The big Bears goals now will be to score early, and score in the third quarter. The Bears have seven points in nine third quarters.They really only had first-half leads to protect to any degree in the wins over the Giants and Panthers. Beyond that, it's been an uphill struggle each week as they've failed to support their defense.Now it's Lazor's chance to try and breathe some life into a carcass.""Is it going to perfect? No. Is every call going to be great? No,"" Nagy said. ""But that's OK, and we'll work through that. And I am going to be the biggest supporter of my coaches that I have on staff because I believe in them and I trust in them.""Considering how the Bears have gone from 21st in Nagy's first year on offense, to 29th last year and stand 30th going into Monday night's game, it is easy to see why he made the decision.Whether it can achieve anything considering the lack of talent and offensive line injuries remains to be seen.Twitter: BearDigest@BearsOnMavenIt's not a simple one-step procedure for the Chicago Bears to find a running attack in the final six games but it has to be done or they not only can forget about the playoffs, but they might be putting coaching jobs and personnel jobs in jeopardyGene ChamberlainJust like in 2019, the Chicago Bears have now suffered a four-game midseason losing streak after a 19-13 defeat by the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football, one made worse by the loss of quarterback Nick Foles to a leg/hip injury."

Winds 11 mph out of west, northwest. Game time temp 44 degrees Bears made several roster changes in the afternoon prior to Monday night's game, including a few which could greatly impact their starting offensive line.Starting center Cody Whitehair was activated from the Reserve/COVID-19 list. Whitehair has been on there for almost two weeks, and he also had a calf injury which had forced him to leave the game with the Rams late three weeks ago.If Whitehair is able to start, the Bears also could have another veteran lineman playing because they have activated Eric Kush from the practice squad to the roster, along with running back Lamar Miller.This would be Miller's first NFL action since August, 2019, when he suffered a torn ACL while with Houston.  Alex Bars is starting at left guard alongside Whitehair with the first team, so Kush would appear to be slated for backup duties.Kush last started for the Bears in the 2018 season. He started the first seven games that season before a neck injury and last year played for Cleveland.Mario Edwards will start at right defensive end with the season-ending injury to Roy Robertson-Harris. Bilal Nichols is at starting nose tackle.They have also elevated quarterback Tyler Bray as a COVID-19 replacement. Reserve lineman Lachavious Simmons is still on Reserve/COVID-19 and Bray is needed on the 53-man roster because Mitchell Trubisky has been ruled out for Monday's game due to a right shoulder injury.Also, nose tackle Daniel McCullers was promoted to the 53-man roster from the practice squad. Nose tackle John Jenkins has an ankle injury and has been ruled out for the game.The Bears come into Monday night's game with a 56-60-2 record against the Vikings in a series dating back to 1961.

102,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/what-bears-can-expect-from-bill-lazor#comments,What Bears Can Expect from Bill Lazor the Play Caller,"Gene ChamberlainIf the Bears can know understand anything from their new play caller's past, it's he cannot work miracles alone.Bill Lazor at least is honest.""I can think back to University of Buffalo, 2001, 2002, we would do anything for a first down,"" Lazor said. Right? Hopefully I've come a long way since then.""Lazor's career calling plays has taken a journey through success and failure at college and pro levels. Either simply seemed to depend greatly on the team.  As he pointed out this weekk: ""Oh, I think every team is a little bit different.""Lazor had three seasons and 14 games as a play caller in the NFL, two seasons with Ryan Tannehill as quarterback in Miami and a season and 14 games with Andy Dalton as quarterback in Cincinnati.So many other factors came into play with each team that it's difficult to pin all the blame on Lazor's play calling or give him credit for a lot. What is apparent is he knows how important it is to balance the pass and run.What's also apparent is he's never been backed by a top-level defense like the Bears have now. So it will be interesting to see how he can play to his team's strength and make for better complementary play between offense, defense and special teams.In past stops, Lazor attempted to achieve balance. He couldn't always do it based on  how effective his talent was, or on how poor his team's defense was. The complementary football wasn't always there. His teams' defenses failed at times, and he couldn't stick with the run.He also showed he could elevate talent somewhat but only to a marginal extent.With Miami, it was Tannehill's third and fourth seasons and he was a late bloomer who really took a huge step when he had a running game for support in Tennessee."

109,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/vikings-deal-bears-fourth-straight-defeat,Frustrated Bears Get Nick Foles Hurt in 19-13 Loss to Vikings,"Gene ChamberlainThe Bears had injuries added to insult, and as a result are not only 5-5 on the year but are heading off into their bye week and possibly NFL oblivion.The worst offensive peformance since Dec. 3, 2017 produced a 19-13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, and in the process they lost both quarterback Nick Foles and defensive end Akiem Hicks, two of their most indispensable players.The Bears had 149 yards, their worst total under Matt Nagy, and had four second-half three-and-outs when the game was there for the taking, after a team record 104-yard kick return touchdown by Cordarrelle Patterson staked them to a 13-7 lead.""Obviously we struggled mightily on offense in having the four three-and-outs in the second half,"" Nagy said. ""We had field position, we couldn't convert on that in the red zone.""It overshadows how well I thought our defense played and the different sudden changes they had, how well our special teams played. I was proud of those guys. So two out of the three parts right now are playing well. It‚Äôs been a constant theme for us.""The new part is the injury to Foles, who was in obvious pain after a near sack when he threw away the ball and Minnesota's Ifeadi Odenigbo in turn threw him on his right shoulder.The injury in the final minute of the game cast a shadow over the remainder of the season.""It was his leg or his hip,"" Nagy said. ""So I think they're still working through the details on that. I have not talked to him yet in the locker room. I will here after we're done and just make sure he's OK. I know he's upset. It's been frustrating, it's been hard, and that's the part that's difficult through all this because no one wants it more than him to be out there to fight with his teammates.""Foles completed 15 of 26 for 106 yards and was sacked twice, but Bears passers were hit 11 times while throwing.""We've got to just keep using that persistence over resistance and just keep fighting and keep staying together and eventually something here will hopefully change and I think that‚Äôs where we‚Äôve got to believe and trust and keep playing for each other,"" Nagy said.On the positive side was Patterson's kick return touchdown, straight up the right side . Once he picked his spot, he burst through almost untouched to start the second half and deliver a 13-7 lead after Cairo Santos had made first-half field goals of 23 and 42 yards.That was it, though, for Bears scoring. The offense looked like it went into the bye week about two quarters earlier than the defense and special teams.The Bears had two second-half first downs, one on the final desperation drive with less than a minute left and no timeouts‚Äîa drive that ended with Tyler Bray at quarterback because of Foles' injury.""We're not good enough right now,"" Patterson said of the offense. ""Everybody sees that. It's no secret the offense isn't good enough.""Just have to keep stepping up, just playing better because the defense, they're playing lights out each and every week. They're setting us up each and every time to score points and get the win, but we're just not coming out at the top. This bye week is going to be real critical for a lot of people to get healthy and just stay focused on the right thing and just staying healthy, like I said.""Patterson's return broke Gale Sayers' record of 103 yards set in 1967 against Pittsburgh, and it tied him for the NFL record of eight career kick return touchdowns.""Honestly, I've just gotta give it up to those 10 guys that was blocking for me,"" Patterson said. ""Man, they did a heck of a job. We work it every week, man, every week at practice. Every time we get the ball, we want to go out on kickoff return and score.""The trouble is they have to do this because the offense can't score. It's the second time in four weeks they failed to score a touchdown on offense in a game.They went 2 of 11 on third downs after going 2 of 15 the previous week, and this was against a beaten-up Vikings defense. Then they got Foles injured.""Pissed off, disappointment, a lot of emotions, negative emotions right now,"" tackle Charles Leno Jr. said. ""We've got to process. We know it's two Monday nights we didn't perform well. It's just frustrating.""The defense didn't play perfect, lost Hicks to a hamstring injury late, but did produce a Khalil Mack interception and return to set up a wasted scoring opportunity. They also had a fumble recovery by Tashaun Gipson on Minnesota's first drive.The Bears allowed Dan Bailey field goals of 37 and 43 yards in the third quarter to tie, but one of those came after punt returner Dwayne Harris muffed a punt at the Bears 20.The winning touchdown was a 6-yarder to Adam Thielen from Kirk Cousins, who finally got his first Monday Night Football win on his 10th try. It came with 10:06 left, but it could have been 10 days left for all the better the Bears offense has been of late.Cousins completed 25 of 36 for 292 yards and also threw a 17-yard TD pass in the first quarter to Thielen, a one-handed grab.""They were just, like, finding soft spots and they did what they had to do,"" linebacker Roquan Smith said. ""It was good plays, good plays on their behalf. Can't hang our heads on that. We just have to go to the next play and can't dwell on the past at the end of the day.""There's not much to dwell on in the past, especially on offense, and especially over the past four weeks.Twitter: BearDigest@BearsOnMaven EditorNot happening, although it wouldn't be shocking if some of them sold off to others or to current board membersDownright laughable.

110,bears,https://www.si.com/nfl/bears/news/cordarrelle-patterson-sets-and-ties-records-with-return-in-bears-loss,Winning for Bears Takes More Than Cordarrelle Patterson Returns,"Gene ChamberlainCordarrelle Patterson is stamping his name in history books as a return man.The Bears defense is playing as effectively as anyone can expect.The frustration builds anyway after a 19-13 loss Monday night to Minnesota left them 5-5 on the year following a 5-1 start.""Honestly, it just means that I need to do more,"" Patterson said. ""I hold myself accountable to go out there every time and score a touchdown.""So I got to do more for my team and get my team in a better situation to score more touchdowns every time I touch the ball.""So just one kick return touchdown for Patterson on Monday night?   Bah.Patterson darted up the right side after he chose the spot he wanted to attack and went 104 yards without being touched. Then he flashed a peace sign.""I don't know what I did, I blacked out at the time,"" Patterson said, laughing.The Bears blocked it so effectively, Barkevious Mingo was able to arrive at the end zone ahead of Patterson.Now Patterson has eight career kick return touchdowns, tying him for the NFL record with Josh Cribbs and Leon Washington.As the all-time No. 2 kick returner in career average, he has been chasing Bears legend Gale Sayers. Patterson has a 29.9-yard career average and Sayers a 30.6-yard average. So it's going to take some more returns like this before he could catch Sayers.Patterson did catch and overtake Sayers in another area on that return, though. The 104 yards is a Bears record. Sayers' record of 103 yards had stood since 1967.Getting more this year or any other year with the Bears might be tough, though, as Patterson can expect squib kicks like the Vikings did after the return. When a team knows it's possibly the only way the opponent will score, it's fairly simple to take away that component.""Like I say, every time I touch the ball my only goal is to score,"" Patterson said. ""It's nothing less but score a touchdown and help my team out.""The only one who might have run faster than Patterson or Mingo on the play was Eddie Jackson, who was on the sidelines watching and went racing down the sidelines with Patterson.""Oh man, that was a game changer, a momentum changer for sure for us,"" Jackson said.This wasn't quite true. It could have been.The score merely provided a lead, and the Bears defense tried to protect it, but without any help from the offense they eventually gave up a fourth-quarter 6-yard TD pass to Adam Thielen.In the end, Jackson was one of a few players addressing the team in the locker room afterward, breaking down in the process as coach Matt Nagy said.""It's frustrating,"" Jackson said. ""We can't hide that. But at the same time, it's a team. It's a team game, so we got to continue to rally together, depend on one another, hold each other accountable.""If you see your teammate with his head down, we got to speak up, lift up, lift your head up, it the next play. You know what I mean? So we just got to change our attitude as a whole unit, holding each other accountable.""Twitter: BearDigest@BearsOnMavenIt's not a simple one-step procedure for the Chicago Bears to find a running attack in the final six games but it has to be done or they not only can forget about the playoffs, but they might be putting coaching jobs and personnel jobs in jeopardyGene ChamberlainJust like in 2019, the Chicago Bears have now suffered a four-game midseason losing streak after a 19-13 defeat by the Minnesota Vikings on Monday Night Football, one made worse by the loss of quarterback Nick Foles to a leg/hip injury.Gene ChamberlainbyGene ChamberlainThe Bill Lazor Experiment Wasn't a Success Even if It ContinuesGene ChamberlainAn injury to Nick Foles isn't as severe as anticipated but Chicago Bears coach Matt Nagy says he's leaving everything on the table at this point regarding the quarterbacks and the offense as they head to a bye week.Gene ChamberlainThe Chicago Bears offense was a prime-time embarrassment as they failed to support their defense and special teams in a 19-13 loss to Minnesota.Gene ChamberlainHere's How SI Sees Monday Night with VikingsGene ChamberlainbyGene ChamberlainThe Chicago Bears could have two veteran starters on the offensive line who didn't play last week as starting center Cody Whitehair has been activated from the Reserve/COVID-19 list and Eric Kush has also been activated after rejoining the team last week following a year in Cleveland.Gene ChamberlainBill Lazor has had some success and some failure calling plays in the NFL but this will be the first time he's tried to do it with a defense of this caliber backing up his offensive efforts.Gene ChamberlainA game-day capsule glance at the Chicago Bears game at Soldier Field Monday night against the Minnesota Vikings.

The Vikings are going to want to run away from Mack and Hicks because they'll cave in most runs. The left side is wide open and it's where they run best. In fact, they break more longer runs on Reiff's side of the field. They average 7.16 yards per run to the left edge and also behind left tackle. While they are formidable running it anyway, the left side has been their best bet. The fact Roy Robertson-Harris is no longer available to man the right defensive end spot alongside Quinn makes it all the more challenging for the Bears on defense. The Vikings running attack likes to have Reiff get to the second level. He'll put a quick initial hit on the edge player, then quickly go to the linebacker or safety and wall off. They're able to gash defenses better this way. Quinn will have to be more stout against the run and occupy Reiff to keep this from happening. Reiff hasn't always been an effective pass blocker but this year hasn't allowed a sack and Pro Football Focus gives him an excellent 77.0 grade protecting Kirk Cousins.Bears TE Jimmy Graham vs. Vikings SS Harrison SmithGraham hasn't been the dud most so-called experts predicted. He is tied for sixth in the NFL among tight ends in receptions with 35 and tied for third in touchdown catches with five, just one off the NFL lead. There are obvious problems with Graham getting far downfield now as he's no longer as fast, but he has shown good hands. The problem the Bears face in this matchup is Smith is a very physical, quick strong safety. Even when younger Graham was always at his best when he could use his height, size and athleticism to overwhelm an opponent. Smith is possibly the best strong safety in the league so this won't happen. The Vikings have had to keep Smith at home more this year because of all the youth and turnover at cornerback, but he still leads them in passes defensed (4) and has always been a problem to the Bears even when they had faster tight ends than Graham playing. Bears C/G Eric Kush vs. Vikings LB Eric WilsonThis could be a disaster for the Bears since Kush just came back to Halas Hall this week, but he did play in Chicago for three years before leaving last year for a season. He is a center so at least they're not throwing in a player with no experience at the position like with Alex Bars last week. Zimmer loves having linebackers blitz the A-gap and expect it to be Wilson coming, especially with a different center in place. Wilson is one of the most effective Vikings pass rushers this year even though he hasn't blitzed often. He leads their linebackers in quarterback hits and is half a sack off his career high with 2 1/2. There is an outside chance Cody Whitehair could return for this game after being on the Reserve/COVID-19 list, but he also had a calf injury to address.Bears WR Allen Robinson vs. Vikings CB Kris BoydThis isn't the matchup the Vikings would want but it's possible they'll be going with it due to all the injuries they've been hit with at cornerback. Rookie Cameron Dantzler is out after a concussion. Boyd gives up about 3 inches of height to Robinson and has limited experience. Robinson continues to put his contract situation into the background and delivers. While averaging six receptions for 79 yards, Robinson has gone five straight weeks without a 100-yard effort but has been in the 80s in yardage the last two games. The Bears keep saying Robinson is open even when he's not open, and this is actually true considering his ability to grab a back-shoulder throw or a 50-50 ball. What doesn't seem to be in their game plan enough is making these types of throws earlier in games. It's always when they get desperate and are trying come up with big chunks of yardage against softer zone coverage. They need to go to Robinson early and often in this one but the Vikings are sure to focus a double team in zone on Robinson so it won't be simple.Bears WR Anthony Miller vs. Vikings CB Jeff GladneyWith 13 catches for 132 yards in the last two games, Miller has upped his performance but had an unfortunate lost fumble after a catch against Tennessee to help seal the loss. His trend in the passing game had been upward before the play. Gladney size-wise is a good match for Miller. Gladney is a rookie but has been one of the more effective Vikings coverage players. There is no physical edge here, but Miller's quickness can win the day. The Vikings bring Gladney inside to the slot in passing situations and he has not been impressive, although he has improved of late. He has given up a passer rating of 128.2 against, as well as five touchdown passes.Bears DE Akiem Hicks vs. Vikings RG Ezra ClevelandHicks has gone quiet as a pass rusher in terms of sacks, with none since Week 3 after he started fast with 3 1/2. But he's continued to pressure with 13 quarterback hiits to date with eight hurries and 18 total pressures according to Sportradar. Hicks in 2018 had two of his best games against the Vikings with six tackles for loss and 2 1/2 sacks. He didn't play against them last year due to knee and elbow injuries. The right guard spot has been a real problem for the Minnesota line. Dru Samia was playing it and had struggled greatly. He gave up three sacks and Pro Football Focus gave him a 17.6 pass blocking grade. The Vikings have turned to rookie tackle prospect Ezra Cleveland at right guard and he has solidified it somewhat the last two games against the Packers and Lions, but has been shaky as a pass blocker with a 45. 6 PFF grade and a sack allowed. Cleveland is a quick-footed technique blocker who rates as a good tackle prospect. Putting him inside against a mauling, massive 350-pound defensive lineman like Hicks will be a different challenge or him.Of NoteLamar Miller will make his Bears debut as a running back. Miller tore an ACL in preseason of 2019 with Houston. He is in his eighth NFL season and ran for 709 yards or more six times. ... Bears LB Roquan Smith leads the NFL in solo tackles with 62. Minnesota's Eric Kendricks has 59 and is second. ... WR Darnell Mooney has 31 receptions. The Bears rookie record for wide receivers is 45 (Harlon Hill). ... Bears receiver Allen Robinson has 13 receptions of 20 yards or longer and went into this week tied for the most in the NFL with Atlanta's Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley. ... Dalvin Cook leads the NFL in rushing and last week had a career-high 252 yards from scrimmage, making him the third player in NFL history with at least 225 yards from scrimmage and two TDs in consecutive games (Jim Brown 1963, Deuce McAllister 2003). ... Vikings wide receiver Justin Jefferson leads NFL rookies with 627 receiving yards. ... The Vikings rank last in the league in average starting field position (23.7-yard line) and in the opponents' average starting posiition (34-yard line). ... The Bears are first at defending third downs and first at red zone defense. The Vikings lead the NFL in average yards gained on first-down plays (7.4).

Edwards took the blame for what his DC called an ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù moment on Sunday, which was allowing Giants quarterback Daniel Jones to rip off another long run against the defense, rolling 34 yards mostly untouched for the first touchdown of what became a 27-17 New York win.Of course, it was Jones who rumbled 80 yards in the first meeting between the two teams but fell down without being touched before he could make it to the goal line. Sunday‚Äôs play came from the same formation, and yet the defense could not prevent Jones from scoring his first touchdown of the season.‚ÄúYeah, recognized it, repped it in practice and things like that,‚Äù said Edwards. ‚ÄúI got inside the block, I should have been outside squeezing that ball back and making it cut back inside, so I fully take responsibility for that.‚ÄúIt was one of those things where I wish I could have it back and we saw it again later in the game and knocked it out, but it's one of those things where you got to be ready the first time. So, it is, you know, one of those things where I wish I could take back, but I can't and ready to look forward to this week.""Edwards shouldn‚Äôt carry the burden of blame alone. Josh Sweat, after all, was spotted crashing down the line of scrimmage, biting hard on a fake handoff and opening a yawning hole for Jones to scoot through.It should also be pointed out that Edwards has done a nice job in the tackling department since returning from Injured Reserve against the Cowboys earlier this month. He has 20 tackles in two games, 12 of which are solo.Alex Singleton has been right there with Edwards, collecting 20 tackles in two games, with 13 solo stops.The challenge grows greater this Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, who have the NFL‚Äôs fourth-ranked rushing offense with Kareem Hunt (663 yards rushing) and Nick Chubb (461) doing most of the damage.‚ÄúOur biggest challenge of the season in the run game,‚Äù said defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz. ‚ÄúAnd how well we stop the run is going to go a long way to how well we play in this game. They are an outstanding run team. Probably the best two running backs we face this year. Not just the best two on the team, but the best two overall. Great balance. Great power.‚ÄúThey know what they want to do in the run game. Nothing sort of takes them out of it. There's not a whole lot you can do scheme-wise that forces them to do something else.

It doesn't matter what your look is, and they are going to take that attitude of if you have an unblocked guy, the running back is going to try to run over them.‚ÄùIf the Eagles have an edge it‚Äôs that quarterback Baker Mayfield isn‚Äôt much of a threat in the run game, nor are receivers Jarvis Landry, Donovan Peoples-Jones, or Rashard Higgins.That‚Äôs good news because it‚Äôs been quarterbacks and wide receivers who have killed the Eagles in the run game this year. Five of the six longest runs against them have been by QBs or WRs, not running backs.Still, Hunt and Chubb are capable of doing it on their own.‚ÄúYou see those guys hitting the hole 100 miles an hour and not looking to stop anytime soon,‚Äù said Edwards. ‚ÄúOnce they get through those interior run gaps they're out the gate so I think we have to do a good job of reading our keys, squeezing those gaps, and trying to make it more difficult for them.

130,eagles,https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/eagles-o-line-warts-show-up-again,Eagles O-Line Warts Show up Again,"John McMullenNov 16, 2020EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Just about everyone has looked for themes to explain the struggles of the Eagles' 3-5-1 start to the 2020 season.Plenty have offered their opinions from outside the NovaCare Complex while those inside the organization, particularly head coach Doug Pederson and quarterback Carson Wentz, have been sure to keep any finger-pointing under a macro lens.According to the Eagles' leaders, the blame should be divvied out in equal pieces like a pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.The offensive line, particularly the interior, didn't get that memo on Sunday, however, and the big boys sliced up a piece of the blame during the 27-17 setback to the New York Giants that was fit for a king.The eighth different O-Line group in nine games again did no favors for Wentz in the loss.What started out as an optimistic week with hopes of seeing Isaac Seumalo as the starting left guard for the first time since Week 2 and Nate Herbig bringing his steady, if unspectacular, presence to RG, was upended on Play 1 when it was the overmatched Sua Opeta and Matt Pryor flanking All-Pro center Jason Kelce.Even Kelce wasn't himself, turning into ""Wild Thing"" Ricky Vaughn with his shotgun snaps, perhaps due to the presence of the 320-pound Dalvin Tomlinson on his nose or the realization of how much help Opeta and Pryor were going to need on a snap-to-snap basis.Too often the middle of the offensive line was a sieve and Wentz was being engulfed. More so, even when it held up the Eagles' quarterback was seeing ghosts and expecting the pressure that he was sure was coming.Call it a prophecy vs. a self-fulfilling one.And neither was positive so if you want to start handing out blame for the Giants halting a four-year losing streak that spanned Donald Trump being elected and defeated, start with the interior of the offensive line.It was telling that none of the Eagles' offensive linemen were made available in postgame Zoom interviews.""(We) just felt that was the best five,"" Pederson said with the thought Seumalo needed more time to ramp back up. ""Herbig did sustain a little hand issue during the week of practice and just wanted to make sure he was fine, but Opeta had really stepped in and done nice during the week of practice. I felt comfortable putting him in there and (offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland) and I had conversations on that, and that was our five.""The result was Seumalo conjuring up memories of Randall McDaniel and Herbig evoking the sunny days of John Hannah from the sidelines.When poor is in play, average looks like a supermodel.John McMullen contributes Eagles coverage for SI.com's EagleMaven and is the NFL Insider for JAKIB Media.

136,eagles,https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/run-defense-has-jim-schwartz-scrambling,Run Defense Has Jim Schwartz Scrambling,"John McMullenPHILADELPHIA - Jim Schwartz clued us in on Tuesday about Daniel Jones' 34-yard touchdown run 48 hours earlier.The Eagles knew it was coming after allowing an 80-yard gash to the athletic Giants quarterback on the same type of look back on Oct. 22.The defense watched it on film and prepared for it in practice because it knew Joe Judge and Jason Garrett wanted a sequel. And the defense got it right away.The game's first drive in the ugly 27-17 loss to the Giants was punctuated by Jones on the zone-read taking it to the house.‚ÄúThe defense broke down on that play,‚Äù a frustrated Schwartz said on Tuesday.The Eagles defensive coordinator is never one to single out individual players but had no problem admitting the result was unacceptable after they saw Jones reach 21-plus MPH on his spectacular run last month at Lincoln Financial Field.‚ÄúFirst game, it was a little bit of a surprise, they ran out of a formation we hadn‚Äôt seen before,"" said Schwartz. ""But it was embarrassing in this game because they ran out of the exact same formation and we fit it wrong. The guy that‚Äôs supposed to be there for the quarterback wasn‚Äôt there.""Nobody else got off any blocks and (Jones) made us pay with a touchdown.‚ÄùWhen viewing the play, typically the QB reads the unaccounted for defender, in this case right defensive end Josh Sweat, who crashed down very hard on the fake toward the running back. From there, the second level was unable to get off blocks to make up for Sweat's misevaluation.Jones, who finished the game as the Giants leading rusher with 64 yards, had another TD run called back when Giants rookie left tackle Andrew Thomas was called for holding."
138,eagles,https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/eagles-o-line-warts-show-up-again,Eagles O-Line Warts Show up Again,"John McMullenEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Just about everyone has looked for themes to explain the struggles of the Eagles' 3-5-1 start to the 2020 season.Plenty have offered their opinions from outside the NovaCare Complex while those inside the organization, particularly head coach Doug Pederson and quarterback Carson Wentz, have been sure to keep any finger-pointing under a macro lens.According to the Eagles' leaders, the blame should be divvied out in equal pieces like a pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.The offensive line, particularly the interior, didn't get that memo on Sunday, however, and the big boys sliced up a piece of the blame during the 27-17 setback to the New York Giants that was fit for a king.The eighth different O-Line group in nine games again did no favors for Wentz in the loss.What started out as an optimistic week with hopes of seeing Isaac Seumalo as the starting left guard for the first time since Week 2 and Nate Herbig bringing his steady, if unspectacular, presence to RG, was upended on Play 1 when it was the overmatched Sua Opeta and Matt Pryor flanking All-Pro center Jason Kelce.Even Kelce wasn't himself, turning into ""Wild Thing"" Ricky Vaughn with his shotgun snaps, perhaps due to the presence of the 320-pound Dalvin Tomlinson on his nose or the realization of how much help Opeta and Pryor were going to need on a snap-to-snap basis.Too often the middle of the offensive line was a sieve and Wentz was being engulfed. More so, even when it held up the Eagles' quarterback was seeing ghosts and expecting the pressure that he was sure was coming."

""It frustrates me to no end. We have too much pride, I have too much pride. These players have too much pride. We work our ass off during the week. It is frustrating. It is frustrating. Blame it on me all you want. I'll handle it with the players, you can blame it on me. I'm a big guy. It's fine.""Shouldering the blame is what good coaches need to do so Pederson checked the box there.The more concerning part is the haughtiness that accompanies that sentiment which marches on unabated even as Super Bowl LII drifts farther away off in the distance of the rear-view mirror.There is a constant belief inside the NovaCare Complex that the 3-5-1 Eagles are beating themselves.""We're self-inflicted ourselves,"" said Pederson. ""We are killing ourselves. We are shooting ourselves in the foot. All of those cliche little statements are still showing up and it's frustrating."""

155,eagles,https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/special-teams-have-struggled-lately-to-live-up-to-being-special,"Special Teams Have Struggled Lately to Live up to Being ""Special""","Ed KraczThere was a time not long ago when the Eagles‚Äô special teams were indeed special, with Chris Maragos and Bryan Braman wreaking havoc and Darren Sproles a threat to take a punt to the house any time a team dared him.These days, the special team units have yet to live up to that ‚Äúspecial‚Äù billing.It‚Äôs been a season-long issue that has mostly been an issue on the perimeter, nagging a bit here with some of kicker Jake Elliott‚Äôs missed field goals, but on a team that is as offensively challenged as the Eagles right now, the harsh spotlight shined turned on the special team units in Sunday‚Äôs 27-17 loss to the New York Giants.The Eagles had horrible field position throughout the loss. None of their 10 drives during their 27-17 loss to the New York Giants began beyond the 25-yard line and four of them started at the 11-yard-line or worse.‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt do a good enough job getting our offense field position in our phase,‚Äù said special teams coordinator Dave Fipp, who has been running the ST show for Philadelphia since Chip Kelly brought him aboard in 2013.‚ÄúObviously, they had the 71-yard punt where the ball went over our head‚Ä¶The ball going over our heads, you just can‚Äôt do that. You can‚Äôt give good football teams or any team in this league that much field position, so certainly we have to catch the football. It starts with that.‚ÄùSo, that‚Äôs where we will start.Jalen Reagor was the punt returner on a punt that was boomed by Riley Dixon. Reagor began retreating but stopped at the 20 and peeled off. The ball hit at the 15 and bounded to the 6.‚ÄúObviously, the guy hit a bomb, went over his head,‚Äù said Fipp, on Tuesday. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Anytime you kick it that far you have a little more time to get back there and catch the thing. You don‚Äôt have gunners in your face because it‚Äôs a further punt. He did it in college.‚ÄúI think he is a developing player. By no means am I saying he shouldn‚Äôt be able to handle that. I know he knows he can do it. We know he can do it. I believe in him. I think he‚Äôs going to be a really good player back there.‚ÄùLater, Greg Ward was in position to catch the ball at the 12 but let hit land about a yard behind him at the 11 and the ball rolled to the 5.‚ÄúGreg‚Äôs was a little bit different than Jalen‚Äôs,‚Äù said Fipp. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I think (Ward‚Äôs) got caught up in a gust of wind and he didn‚Äôt feel comfortable catching the ball, so he didn‚Äôt. Obviously, we‚Äôd rather have him catch that ball. I‚Äôd rather have him also let it go than muff a catch if he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with it. That being said, we get paid to catch the football back there.‚ÄùThen there were the two penalties that cost the Eagles field position after decent kickoff returns by Boston Scott.The first was a hold on Corey Clement after the Giants had taken a 14-3 lead. Scott returned the ball to the 34, but the penalty pushed the ball back to the 9.Then to start the second half, Scott advanced to the 28 but a block in the back against Shaun Bradley moved the Eagles back to the 16.‚ÄúUnfortunately, it seems that every time we have a decent return, we also have a penalty to go along with it,‚Äù said Fipp. ‚ÄúI thought there was a lot of good blocking on both those kickoff returns, and we had about nine guys doing a great job then, unfortunately, we had a couple blocks that were decisions that we just can‚Äôt do. I have to do a better job putting those guys in better situations in practice. It definitely hurts us.‚ÄùJabril Peppers also hurt the Eagles in the punt return game, with four returns for 47 yards.‚ÄúI would say it was a combination of both punt and coverage,‚Äù said Fipp about Peppers‚Äô returns. ‚ÄúWe just didn‚Äôt execute well enough as a group.‚ÄùGet the latest Eagles news by joining the community.

More so, even when it held up the Eagles' quarterback was seeing ghosts and expecting the pressure that he was sure was coming.Call it a prophecy vs. a self-fulfilling one.And neither was positive so if you want to start handing out blame for the Giants halting a four-year losing streak that spanned Donald Trump being elected and defeated, start with the interior of the offensive line.It was telling that none of the Eagles' offensive linemen were made available in postgame Zoom interviews."

He‚Äôs thrown the ball twice in 30 snaps and completed both passes. Those throwing plays have been the outlier, though.Stack the box and look for the run. The Eagles have made it that simple.The proactive approach would have been to adjust the use of Hurts before a defense did and the Eagles had plenty of time to do that having played only one game in 24 days before losing to the Giants on Sunday.Except nothing changed.Hurts played three snaps against New York. He ran twice and lost one yard in those carries.‚ÄúI think early on (in the season), we've been very explosive with him,‚Äù said head coach Doug Pederson on Monday. ‚ÄúGosh, I think we were close to 11 or 12 yards per attempt when he was in the game, something like that. I would say here recently, defenses are playing him a little bit differently. They have had chances to scout him.‚ÄùThat was to be expected. So, too, was an adjustment from Pederson and his staff. Find different uses for him.A novel idea was thrown at Pederson on Monday about maybe taking Carson Wentz off the field completely when Hurts comes on, rather than line up Wentz as a receiver that everybody knows isn‚Äôt getting thrown to.It is as the reporter pointed out what the New Orleans Saints do when they put Taysom Hill in for Drew Brees. Head coach Sean Payton removes Brees from the game completely.‚ÄúSure,‚Äù said Pederson. ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, that's a good idea.‚ÄùThe follow up was, why haven‚Äôt you done that?‚ÄúIt's a great idea,‚Äù said the coach. ‚ÄúSomething we'll look into.‚ÄùThe coach was being snarky, at least one would hope so, though, to be honest, it wasn‚Äôt that easy to tell.Pederson‚Äôs press conferences sometimes tend to veer into the bizarre, maybe more so this season.Last week, it was the three questions he needed to be asked to distance himself from his friend Brett Favre‚Äôs remarks regarding the Hall of Fame QB's opinion about keeping Nick Foles over Carson Wentz.Earlier, it was his comments about sitting down Jordan Mailata in order to help him learn how to play a better tackle position by watching, something he compared to sitting Nelson Agholor down in the 2016 season, even though the two situations had nothing to with each other.Now, the Hurts stuff.Pederson is mostly right about Hurts being effective early.He averaged four yards on two carries in his pro debut against the Bengals in Week 3 that went up to six yards on three runs against the 49ers. After not running the ball the next week but throwing it for an 18-yard gain against the Steelers, Hurts averaged 11.5 yards per carry on two attempts against the Ravens.Since then, he has been relatively ineffective and rarely used.‚ÄúWe could probably do a little bit more with him,‚Äù said Pederson.There have been some fumbling issues, but Pederson said those are a result of bad snaps from Jason Kelce.‚ÄúI've talked to Kelce about this before, and he's had a little history and he knows it, and listen, he's a pro and he's going to get it fixed, but we have to get that center quarterback exchange dialed in and a couple of those were low and those are hard to handle,‚Äù said Pederson. ‚ÄúSo I wouldn't put them all on Jalen, no.‚ÄùIn the grand scheme of things, there are bigger issues going on than what to do with Hurts, but making him more of a threat, turning him into a spark, can only help.As for Hurts‚Äô thoughts, nobody knows.

171,eagles,https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/the-day-after-angry-eagles-missing-the-point#comments,The Day After: Angry Eagles Missing the Point,"John McMullenPHILADELPHIA - The Eagles should be upset with themselves, a narrative Jalen Mills expressed moments after a 27-17 loss to the New York Giants on Sunday and one Doug Pederson latched onto during his Monday morning radio spot with the team's flagship radio station.""I'm pissed off at myself (and) I'm pissed off at the way we played,"" Pederson told WIP Sports Radio. ""It frustrates me to no end. We have too much pride, I have too much pride. These players have too much pride. We work our ass off during the week. It is frustrating. It is frustrating. Blame it on me all you want. I'll handle it with the players, you can blame it on me. I'm a big guy. It's fine.""Shouldering the blame is what good coaches need to do so Pederson checked the box there.The more concerning part is the haughtiness that accompanies that sentiment which marches on unabated even as Super Bowl LII drifts farther away off in the distance of the rear-view mirror.There is a constant belief inside the NovaCare Complex that the 3-5-1 Eagles are beating themselves.""We're self-inflicted ourselves,"" said Pederson. ""We are killing ourselves. We are shooting ourselves in the foot. All of those cliche little statements are still showing up and it's frustrating.""From the press box at MetLife Stadium it sure looked like the New York Giants were the better football team on Sunday afternoon, and back on Oct. 22 when the Giants held a 21-10 advantage with less than six minutes to go the Pederson himself admitted New York had his team beat before the miracle comeback.So maybe Occam‚Äôs Razor applies here and the young and improving Giants are better than Philadelphia right now.On Sunday, once Giants Killer Boston Scott went 56 yards to the house early in the third quarter, the thought was that order would be restored.Until Sterling Shephard beat Avonte Maddox with a beautifully run slot fade for 27 yards and then former Eagles receiver Golden Tate went up over Nickell Robey-Coleman for 38 yards.Of course, you could make a strong argument, those consecutive plays on the subsequent drive did restore order - for the better football team.Yes, there were too many penalties by the Eagles, and an 0-for-9 on third down is always about execution especially on the manageable opportunities that favored the offense.But, the Giants played better on both fronts, their talented defensive line eating up a banged-up Eagles interior and their fast-improving O-Line more than holding its own against what is supposed to be Philadelphia's strength, the defensive front.The Giants are still learning how to win under rookie head coach Joe Judge and second-year quarterback Daniel Jones but New York is clearly the ascending team here after years of making poor decisions in the post-Tom Coughlin era.The Eagles, meanwhile are the ship passing in the night, creeping toward the storm that looks worse than the end of days-like supercell that greeted us all on the Jersey Turnpike traveling back from MetLife Stadium, the result of standing pat for far too long with an aging and expensive roster.Like any emotion, anger is the enemy of logic.The Eagles are living in a perpetual Super Bowl stasis and believe they are better than the Giants, something 1,470 days of dominance will feed into.Here's the tough love, though.The Eagles have been mediocre since that cold winter's night in Minneapolis back in February of 2018 and they are only getting worse, pissed off or not.John McMullen contributes Eagles coverage for SI.com's EagleMaven and is the NFL Insider for JAKIB Media.

172,eagles,https://www.si.com/nfl/eagles/news/jalen-reagor-focused-on-conquering-his-journey-not-what-anyone-else-is-doing,"Jalen Reagor Focused on ""Conquering His Journey"" not What Anyone Else is Doing","Ed KraczPatience has never been a strong suit for an Eagles fan base that had to wait 52 years for its first Super Bowl title.Now, it is Justin Jefferson who is trying that patience. He was the receiver the Eagles had a chance to take with the 21st pick last spring, but instead went with Jalen Reagor, allowing the Vikings to sprint to the podium to announce they were taking Jefferson with the 22nd selection.Jefferson stepped into the national spotlight on Monday night and didn‚Äôt blink, making eight catches on 10 targets for 135 yards in a win over the Chicago Bears on Monday Night Football. It was the fourth time he‚Äôs been over 100 yards in 10 games this season and he now has 42 receptions for 742 yards and three touchdowns.Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, rookie receiver Jalen Reagor is answering questions about why he didn‚Äôt catch a punt that sailed over his head in Sunday‚Äôs loss to the New York Giants.Reagor will never hear the end of the comparison with Jefferson until he begins to match the production expected from a first-round pick, and even if he does, he may still hear the comparisons forever.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only person people bring up,‚Äù said Reagor on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for me to watch another man‚Äôs success and be like I wish was. He hasn‚Äôt had any injuries. I have. I can‚Äôt watch another man‚Äôs journey. I just have to be ready to conquer mine when the time comes. Like I said, what‚Äôs life without scars?‚ÄùReagor expressed some frustration about continually being asked about Jefferson. It was a deep wide receiver class, after all.‚ÄúThe longer you bring it up, I‚Äôll just keep giving y‚Äôall the same answers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall keep bringing it up, y‚Äôall can keep saying when guys like, when guys like, what else do you want me to do? I can‚Äôt go make those things happen. It‚Äôs just certain things you just gotta know when your time‚Äôs coming, it‚Äôs going to come, and what‚Äôs meant to be, it‚Äôll be.‚ÄùReagor‚Äôs career has gotten off to a slow start due to two injuries. The first, a shoulder, cut short his training camp. The second, a thumb, cost him five games.He has played two games since his return prior to the bye and has seven catches for 63 yards, six rushing yards, and a touchdown in those two games. In his four games this season, Reagor has 12 receptions for 159 yards and one TD.Bigger things figure to be on the horizon over these final seven games, especially as the chemistry and trust build between him and quarterback Carson Wentz.Those two intangibles were what Reagor missed out on most as he rehabbed two injuries.‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt able to get those practice reps with Carson, but like I said, it is what it is,‚Äù said Reagor, who is still just 21. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt out there, that‚Äôs a part of growing and getting chemistry. Then it doesn‚Äôt make it any better than I‚Äôm a rookie, so he has to build trust in me and what I‚Äôm doing to get comfortable.‚ÄúLook at him and (tight end Zach) Ertz. It‚Äôs chemistry. I haven‚Äôt been here. I got hurt, had two injuries, so like I said, whenever my time is called, I‚Äôm going to make the best of it. I just have to keep climbing the mountain each and every day, I can‚Äôt make excuses.‚ÄùGet the latest Eagles news by joining the community. Click ""Follow"" at the top right of the EagleMaven page.

Notably, it was their biggest home underdog spread since the San Francisco 49ers were favored by 14.5-points at Texas Stadium in 1989.The Vikings beat the Chicago Bears on Monday night and only have a six-day turnaround until Sunday‚Äôs game against the Cowboys.Records: Dallas Cowboys (2-7, 0-4 Away) vs. Minnesota Vikings (3-5, 1-3 Home)[READ: Cowboys 1st & 10: A Peek at the 2021 NFL Draft][Source: Cowboys 'Looking' At Former First-Round CB DeAndre Baker]Here are some recent betting trends to know before laying down moolah:My best bet?

So the news that New York Giants first-year head coach Joe Judge has fired offensive line coach Colombo, paired with the rumor that the dismissal is the result of a fist-fight between the pair, draws me to one immediate conclusion:Joe Judge has a death wish.The Giants are moving away from Colombo, who of course had a fine career as a Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman before moving into coaching a couple of years ago in Dallas, and then shifting to the Giants when Judge hired Jason Garrett as his coordinator. New York is reportedly hiring Dave DeGuglielmo to replace him on the coaching staff.Both Colombo and DeGuglielmo interviewed for the offensive line coaching job when Judge was looking for help. What he got in Colombo was guy as smart as he is tough ...And a guy who, as a 6-8, 315-pound player and even now in slimmed-down form, obviously, stands up for what he believes.READ MORE: Cowboys Making Four Roster Moves TodayREAD MORE: Cowboys Sign Ex Chiefs Second-Round D-LinemanColombo is also a guy who wins his fights. I can argue that he's helped the Giants become respectable (their three-win total is a surprise to me) though the New York O-line remains young and problematic. ... and it appears as though Colombo argued with a decision from Judge that Colombo make changes - maybe even agree to take a backseat to a possible new hiring of DeGuglielmo.There really wasn't a fist-fight ... But if there was, I have a guess at who would've ended it.During his playing days, Colombo was challenged to a post-practice  fight by teammate Jay Ratliff. Ratliff was himself a big man, and a bad man ... and as the story goes, Ratliff's plan was to hide around a corner and sucker-punch his foe.Somebody alerted Colombo to that devious plan. So he marched down an alternate hallway, so Ratliff could see him coming. The two squared up ... and Colombo had to be pulled off the 6-4, 287-pound Ratliff before too much damage was done.I've got a call into Colombo to confirm that if the Judge-related ""violence'' story is untrue; my understanding is that tempers flared, not fists. But for now and for me? I'll take Marc Colombo's side - and if I'm ever in an alley fight, I'll take him on my side, too.The Dallas Cowboys Are Making Four Roster Moves Today As They Ready For Sunday's Game At MinnesotaMike FisherDallas Cowboys at Minnesota Vikings: NFL Betting Odds & TrendsBriAmaranthusDallas Cowboys Sign Ex Chiefs Second-Round D-Lineman Breeland SpeaksMike FisherThe Dallas Cowboys welcome back quarterback Andy Dalton vs. Minnesota Vikings. ... and eye the SI NFL Power RankingsBriAmaranthusSource: Now That He's Cleared Of Legal Trouble, The Dallas Cowboys Are 'Looking' At Former Giants First-Round CB DeAndre BakerMike FisherLocked on Cowboys: ‚ÄòPep in Step‚Äô - Dallas Back at PracticeMike FisherDallas Cowboys & NFC East: The 'Mr. Irrelevant' Division - Where Everybody Is AliveMike FisherA 'way-too-early' look at what the Dallas Cowboys 'could' do in 2021 via the NFL DraftMatthew PostinsDallas Cowboys Blitzcast: Should Tony Pollard Get Some Of Ezekiel Elliott's Snaps?Mike FisherAmid Trade Talk And Re-Signing Talk, The Dallas Cowboys' Future With Aldon Smith Is More Complicated Than It SeemsMike Fisher"

The Dallas Cowboys rested and started preparation for next Sunday's game in Minnesota.During the off week, quarterback Andy Dalton cleared both concussion and Reserve/COVID-19 protocol. The veteran practiced on Monday and is expected to start, although coach Mike McCarthy has not named him QB1 yet. The Cowboys (2-7) are now No. 27 on the Sports Illustrated list. Dallas is the second lowest ranked NFC East team, in front of only the Washington Football Team at No. 29. As the MMQB team writes:The Cowboys likely get Andy Dalton back this week. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôll matter much, and that‚Äôs less about Dalton than it is about a patched together o-line.Dalton has not played since the Cowboys' Oct. 25 loss to the Washington Football Team, when he suffered the brutal concussion-inducing hit from linebacker Jon Bostic.

The moves, as detailed by coach Mike McCarthy on Wednesday morning:*QB Andy Dalton will be activated today from the Reserve/COVID-19 list. He has spent the last few weeks first in concussion protocol and then on the COVID list. Dalton, the replacement for out-for-the-year Dak Prescott, is the scheduled starter for the game against the Vikings.*Defensive lineman Tyrone Crawford is also coming off the COVID list.*Cornerback Trevon Diggs will be placed on injured reserve today, the result of a foot injury sustained in Dallas' last outing, a home loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. The rookie Diggs could have a six-week rehab and therefore could miss the rest of what has been a fine debut season for him.*In maybe the most important move in terms of it being both a mild surprise and potentially impactful to the team's performance, young offensive tackle Brandon Knight (who's undergone arthroscopic knee surgery and has been on injured reserve) will begin his 21-day practice window today. READ MORE: Cowboys at Vikings: Odds and TrendsREAD MORE: Cowboys Sign Ex Chiefs Second-Round D-LinemanThe Cowboys and this new coaching staff began the year viewing other young offensive linemen as being superior to the undrafted Knight - while the previous coaching staff held him in high regard.It's obvious what Dalton's role will be.

In today's NFL, there is an entire division of ""Mr. Irrelevants.''They are collectively known as ""the NFC East.''‚ÄúI have not,'' Giants coach Joe Judge said Sunday when asked if he's discussed the standings with his team. ""And I‚Äôll tell everyone right now, it‚Äôs irrelevant.''""Irrelevant'' is indeed the word for anyone who does examine and discuss the standings in the NFC Least.The Giants - who were 300-to-1 to win the division just a couple of weeks ago - registered a 27-17 win over the Eagles on Sunday. That dumps Philadelphia to 3-5-1 ... good for first place.The Giants, who previously were only capable of beating Washington, have improved to 3-7.Washington lost 30-27 on a last-second field goal at Detroit (in part due to a foolish Chase Young penalty) and dropped to 2-7.READ MORE: Lions 30 Washington 27: A 'Have-Not' LossAnd amazingly, the Dallas Cowboys experienced relative success by not playing at all, remaining at 2-7 as well.By virtue of Washington's recent 25-3 win over Dallas, the Cowboys are mired in last place in the NFC Least.

201,cowboys,https://www.si.com/nfl/cowboys/news/cowboys-1st-10-a-peek-at-dallas-and-the-2021-nfl-draft,Cowboys 1st & 10: A Peek the NFL Draft,"Matthew PostinsThe Dallas Cowboys, mercifully, are on a bye week. That means you don‚Äôt have to watch them lose this week.Too harsh? Maybe. But, still, enjoy your weekend. While you do that, I spent the week thinking ahead to the 2021 NFL Draft.1) Draft TimeIf the season ended today (mercifully), the Cowboys would have the No. 3 overall pick, which would be their highest overall pick since selecting at No. 4 in 2016 when they picked running back Ezekiel Elliott. So the Cowboys still have some time to ‚Äòscrew that up,‚Äô or to engage in some good old-fashioned ‚Äòorganic tanking.‚ÄôSo, with that in mind, I headed over to thedraftnetwork.com and did my own Cowboys mock draft, a full seven-round draft. My goal was just to see what might be out there. Here are the results of the first three rounds.1 - No. 3 overall ‚Äì OT Penei Sewell, Oregon2 - No. 35 overall ‚Äì CB Shaun Wade, Ohio State3 - No. 67 overall ‚Äî LB Jabril Cox, LSUThose first three picks catch a few key areas. Sewell could prove a ready heir to Tyron Smith‚Äôs left tackle position. Or, the Cowboys could slide Sewell inside and move Zack Martin outside when the time comes (and it may be coming sooner than any of us realize). Wade may end up being a first-round pick by April. But, if he slides into the second round, like Alabama‚Äôs Trevon Diggs did this year, well, there‚Äôs a new starter for the secondary. Cox is an incredibly rangy defender who won national championships at North Dakota State before transferring to LSU this season. He will have no problem fitting into whatever system the Cowboys decide to play.I would be very happy with those three selections, if that‚Äôs how the draft fell out. But, after that, the mock draft I did got interesting.In my mock draft, the Cowboys ended up with seven more selections, which sounds odd, right? You likely know that the Cowboys have made several trades that impact 2021. For instance, the Eagles have the Cowboys‚Äô fifth-round pick, but the Cowboys have the Eagles‚Äô fourth-round pick. The Cowboys also dealt their sixth-rounder to New England last season for defensive end Michael Bennett, but the Cowboys successfully replaced that by dealing Everson Griffen to Detroit a couple of weeks ago (that sixth-rounder is conditional and it could become a fifth-rounder). The Cowboys dealt their seventh-rounder to Houston for defensive tackle Eli Ankou.But the Cowboys have a bit of an ace this year ‚Äî compensatory picks in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth rounds due to free agency losses in the 2020 offseason. That, by my count, gives them seven more selections. This is how the rest of the draft played outS Paris Ford, PittEdge Myjai Sanders, CincinnatiEdge Daelin Hayes, Notre DameCB T.J. Carter MemphisDL Cory Durden, Florida StateEdge Chris Rumph, DukeWR Marquez Stevenson, HoustonWith the remaining seven picks I picked up edge rushers, more help on the interior defensive line, more help in the secondary and an intriguing offensive player in Stevenson.There is potential, given the large number of selections, that the Cowboys could accumulate two or three immediate starters, a wealth of depth or package some of the picks to move up in the draft.There is a lot of real estate between now and next April.But, hey, any silver lining at this point, right?2) The Cowboys in a WordWho would have thought possibly getting a top-five NFL Draft selection would have been in the cards for the 2020 Dallas Cowboys?

The 5-11, 190-pound former college All-America appeared in 15 games for New York last season, but the Giants released him in September following an offseason overflowing with legal trouble - trouble that he was cleared off this week when a district attorney's office in Florida dropped charges against Baker, who was being prosecuted on four counts of robbery with a firearm and faced a minimum of 10 years in prison if convicted.The Giants remain uninterested, and unconvinced that he's the ""great locker-room guy'' he claims to be.‚ÄúI can be a great guy in any locker room they put me in,‚Äù Baker told the New York Daily News. ‚ÄúI never had a record in my life. I was never in any trouble in my life and still to this day I haven‚Äôt been in any trouble, up until this event. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a risk to any team.

Safety Xavier Woods and cornerbacks Chidobe Awuzie and Jourdan Lewis are free after this year.DeAndre Baker, 23, was the Jim Thorpe winner in college and is just 19 months removed from being the 30th overall pick.

210,cowboys,https://www.si.com/nfl/cowboys/news/cowboys-1st-10-a-peek-at-dallas-and-the-2021-nfl-draft,Cowboys 1st & 10: A Peek the NFL Draft,"Matthew PostinsThe Dallas Cowboys, mercifully, are on a bye week. That means you don‚Äôt have to watch them lose this week.Too harsh? Maybe. But, still, enjoy your weekend. While you do that, I spent the week thinking ahead to the 2021 NFL Draft.1) Draft TimeIf the season ended today (mercifully), the Cowboys would have the No. 3 overall pick, which would be their highest overall pick since selecting at No. 4 in 2016 when they picked running back Ezekiel Elliott. So the Cowboys still have some time to ‚Äòscrew that up,‚Äô or to engage in some good old-fashioned ‚Äòorganic tanking.‚ÄôSo, with that in mind, I headed over to thedraftnetwork.com and did my own Cowboys mock draft, a full seven-round draft. My goal was just to see what might be out there. Here are the results of the first three rounds.1 - No. 3 overall ‚Äì OT Penei Sewell, Oregon2 - No. 35 overall ‚Äì CB Shaun Wade, Ohio State3 - No. 67 overall ‚Äî LB Jabril Cox, LSUThose first three picks catch a few key areas. Sewell could prove a ready heir to Tyron Smith‚Äôs left tackle position. Or, the Cowboys could slide Sewell inside and move Zack Martin outside when the time comes (and it may be coming sooner than any of us realize). Wade may end up being a first-round pick by April. But, if he slides into the second round, like Alabama‚Äôs Trevon Diggs did this year, well, there‚Äôs a new starter for the secondary. Cox is an incredibly rangy defender who won national championships at North Dakota State before transferring to LSU this season. He will have no problem fitting into whatever system the Cowboys decide to play.I would be very happy with those three selections, if that‚Äôs how the draft fell out. But, after that, the mock draft I did got interesting.In my mock draft, the Cowboys ended up with seven more selections, which sounds odd, right? You likely know that the Cowboys have made several trades that impact 2021. For instance, the Eagles have the Cowboys‚Äô fifth-round pick, but the Cowboys have the Eagles‚Äô fourth-round pick. The Cowboys also dealt their sixth-rounder to New England last season for defensive end Michael Bennett, but the Cowboys successfully replaced that by dealing Everson Griffen to Detroit a couple of weeks ago (that sixth-rounder is conditional and it could become a fifth-rounder). The Cowboys dealt their seventh-rounder to Houston for defensive tackle Eli Ankou.But the Cowboys have a bit of an ace this year ‚Äî compensatory picks in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth rounds due to free agency losses in the 2020 offseason. That, by my count, gives them seven more selections. This is how the rest of the draft played outS Paris Ford, PittEdge Myjai Sanders, CincinnatiEdge Daelin Hayes, Notre DameCB T.J. Carter MemphisDL Cory Durden, Florida StateEdge Chris Rumph, DukeWR Marquez Stevenson, HoustonWith the remaining seven picks I picked up edge rushers, more help on the interior defensive line, more help in the secondary and an intriguing offensive player in Stevenson.There is potential, given the large number of selections, that the Cowboys could accumulate two or three immediate starters, a wealth of depth or package some of the picks to move up in the draft.There is a lot of real estate between now and next April.But, hey, any silver lining at this point, right?2) The Cowboys in a WordWho would have thought possibly getting a top-five NFL Draft selection would have been in the cards for the 2020 Dallas Cowboys?

Fisher has been a keystone of the Chiefs' offensive line at left tackle for all nine of the team's games in 2020.As we learned with defensive tackle Chris Jones' one-day stint on the Reserve/COVID-19 list, there are still a lot of moving parts for what may happen to the three Chiefs linemen as the team prepares to face the Las Vegas Raiders.If any of the three are positive for COVID-19, they would miss significant time as they recover. If they are close contacts to someone who was COVID-positive, they could return in the days to come after spending five days removed from that close contact.Reports from Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo, both of NFL Network, indicate that at least Fisher and Schwartz were close contacts and have not tested positive for coronavirus at this time.As is always the case in this COVID-impacted NFL season, consider the situation to be fluid. However, at this time, it seems like at least Fisher will have a chance to play against the Raiders on Sunday Night Football if he continues to test negative over the next several days.Schwartz and Rankin, due to their injuries, would likely need to practice for the majority of a week before returning to the field.Just as we thought the Kansas City Chiefs were going to steamroll their way through the AFC West for another year and take an unblemished divisional record into the playoffs, the Las Vegas Raiders had other ideas.Tucker D.

FranklinFollowing the Las Vegas Raiders' stunning 40-32 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on October 11, the Raiders reportedly did something that got under the skin of Chiefs Kingdom ‚Äî and apparently head coach Andy Reid.According to a report from 41 Action News' Nick Jacobs, the Raiders asked the police escort to take them around Arrowhead Stadium for a victory lap after beating the Chiefs in Kansas City for the first time since 2012.As Kansas City prepares to travel to Las Vegas and Allegiant Stadium for the first time, Reid was asked about the Raiders' reported ""victory lap"" in his first press conference of the week.‚ÄúWell, listen, they won the game, so they can do anything they want to do if they end up winning the game,"" Reid said. ""That‚Äôs not our style, but we‚Äôll get ourselves back, ready to play, and that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at.‚ÄùReid brought up the joyride again later in the press conference when he was asked if he'd given much thought to the idea of teams having an advantage or disadvantage in a rematch between divisional foes later in the year.‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt. I think they have, or they wouldn‚Äôt have driven the bus around the stadium,"" Reid said. ""We don‚Äôt, we just try to get ourselves ready for the next team. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you play them once or twice, we just get ready to play them the best we possibly can.‚ÄùLas Vegas is tasked with taking on the Chiefs after their bye week for the third year in a row. In his career, Reid is 18-3 after a regular-season bye.Raiders head coach Jon Gruden was asked about the postgame activities after the game in his Monday meeting with the Las Vegas media. Gruden said he didn't think his actions were ""bulletin board"" material but were used in another way.""You could find a smart-aleck bus driver in Kansas City who made some snide comments when we got on the bus,"" Gruden said. ""Maybe that's why we drove around the stadium. It was to tick him off. You know, this is ridiculous. Next question.""This story about a bus ride now seems to be the latest chapter in one of the NFL's longest-lasting rivalries. Paired with the Raiders getting their second victory against the Chiefs in the teams' last 12 matchups, the rivalry appears to be alive and well as the Chiefs travel to the brand-new Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on Sunday Night Football to avenge their loss from earlier in the year.Just as we thought the Kansas City Chiefs were going to steamroll their way through the AFC West for another year and take an unblemished divisional record into the playoffs, the Las Vegas Raiders had other ideas.Tucker D.

Justin Herbert and Tua Tagovailoa will be forever linked and compared. Along with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, these quarterbacks are having quite the year. Herbert was thrust into the starting role and has come into his own setting rookie records. Tagovailoa has only played in three games but is off to a great start, winning all three. Tua takes the first meeting but it's exciting to think there will be more of these matchups to come.The Chargers remain in last place in the division with a record of 2-7. Next week they host the New York Jets.Las Vegas Raiders 37, Denver Broncos 12.This game went as expected as the Raiders eventually cruised to a victory after the two teams were separated by just four points heading into halftime. Las Vegas was able to grow its margin thanks to four Drew Lock interceptions. Big performances from running backs Josh Jacobs and Devonte Booker helped fill the vacancy of production left by Derek Carr. The Raiders pair of running backs accounted for all four of Vegas' touchdowns and 193 yards on the ground.Las Vegas moves to 6-3 on the season as they grow their lead for second in the division over the Broncos, who drop to 3-6.

253,chiefs,https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/footenotes-travis-kelce-somehow-deserving-more-credit#comments,Appreciate Travis Kelce While He's Playing: The Chiefs' Tight End is an All-Time Great,"Jordan FooteIn case you missed the memo, Travis Kelce is the best tight end in all of football. It isn't a debate. Even referring to him as a tight end feels like selling him short. He's not just one of the best tight ends in NFL history, he's one of the game's all-time greatest pass-catching threats.Kelce is a game-wrecker and a lethal weapon for the Kansas City Chiefs, and a downright horrifying sight for opposing defenses. A true matchup nightmare, players measuring up at 6'5"" and weighing 260 pounds shouldn't be allowed to move the way Kelce can. It simply is not fair. Despite having turned 31 years old on October 5, Kelce is in the middle of what could turn out to be the best season of his career. Through nine games, the two-time All-Pro ranks third in the NFL in receiving yards (769) and yards after the catch (361). He also has six touchdowns, topping the five he had all of last season. His chemistry with quarterback Patrick Mahomes is off the charts. Somehow, though, Kelce deserves even more respect.  Heading into Sunday's win over the Carolina Panthers, Kelce's name was atop the leaderboards in several other statistical categories. He led all tight ends with at least 200 snaps played in Pro Football Focus' grades for run blocking (79.5), receiving (89.6), and overall offense (90.3), putting up better grades than he ever has. His level of play isn't just elite ‚Äî it's all-time great. One of the main points of the George Kittle/Kelce debate for the game's best tight end was centered around run blocking. Kittle received rave reviews for his prowess in that area, while Kelce's quality performances were overlooked. Now, with the 49ers' best offensive player being banged up for most of this season and the Chiefs' leading receiver taking his game to another level, that conversation is over. With that, a new one should begin. It's time to give Kelce his flowers while he's still playing at such an exceptional level.Assuming he remains healthy for the remainder of this season, Kelce will have his fifth-consecutive 1,000-yard season. Heck, if he keeps playing like he has for the past two weeks (109 and 159 receiving yards, respectively), it won't take seven more games to get there. It's a near-lock that the NFL's longest streak that measures tight end greatness will be extended by yet another year. We've never seen anything like it, and we may never see it again. Seriously.Sure, Rob Gronkowski has a 17-touchdown season on his resume. He also had the physical gifts to be the best tight end ever. Health wasn't working in his favor, though. It is for Kelce. Chiefs legend and perhaps the current owner of the ""GOAT"" crown at the position, Tony Gonzalez, topped 1,000 yards four times in his 17-year career. The fact that Kelce has done it that many times in a row while competing for catches with other generational talents like Tyreek Hill is brilliant. It's astonishing. It's mind-boggling ‚Äî and Kelce doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. Kelce is healthy. He's consistently great. His unique physical gifts ‚Äî supreme agility mixed with great speed and size that makes him virtually impossible to cover individually ‚Äî are still at their peak. Even when those traits inevitably begin to decline, he's shown that he can refine his technique enough to make up for most of the difference. Oh yeah, he's also under contract to play with Mahomes until the end of the 2025 season.Acknowledge and enjoy this while it lasts. Kelce solidified his spot as the premier tight end in the NFL, but it's time to think even bigger. He's one of the best receiving threats this league currently has and by the time his already-amazing career comes to a close, he'll go down as a player future generations will aim to model their games after. In the midst of a special time to be a Chiefs fan, don't forget to realize the magnitude of a special talent performing as well as Kelce is.Just as we thought the Kansas City Chiefs were going to steamroll their way through the AFC West for another year and take an unblemished divisional record into the playoffs, the Las Vegas Raiders had other ideas.Tucker D.

254,chiefs,https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/andy-reid-chiefs-primed-for-post-bye-week-statement-game,Andy Reid Has the Chiefs Primed for a Post-Bye Week Statement Game,"Jordan FooteDeath, taxes and Andy Reid coming off a bye week. There are no greater certainties in life.Reid, who has the sixth-most wins among all head coaches in league history, has an 18-3 regular-season record when returning from a bye. Whether it be with the Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles, he's always had his teams in prime position to come back from a week off feeling refreshed, refocused, and ready to go. This season, a relatively late bye week couldn't have come at a better time for the Chiefs.Impact players like Sammy Watkins, Mitchell Schwartz and L'Jarius Sneed are working their way back from injury. The team currently boasts an 8-1 record, good for the No. 2 spot in the AFC. That one loss, a 40-32 defeat at the hands of the Las Vegas Raiders last month, is still fresh in the minds of many. Had the Chiefs handled business against a division rival, they'd be in a more ideal situation in regards to the home-field advantage race. By the time these two teams square off again on Sunday, Reid will have had two weeks to prepare. The stars are aligning for a revenge game, which now has even more storylines than usual thanks to a celebratory bus ride.Despite playing some of the sloppiest football of the Reid and Patrick Mahomes era, the reigning Super Bowl champs lost by a single score to Las Vegas last time out. The Chiefs were penalized 10 times for 94 yards. Raiders quarterback Derek Carr played the game of his life. Rookie wide receiver Henry Ruggs racked up 47 percent of his 2020 yards so far in that contest alone. Defensive coordinator Paul Guenther made a high-flying offense look completely beatable by getting pressure on Mahomes all day long. It was a perfect storm of events ‚Äî and one that likely won't happen again.In Carr's last three games, he's combined to throw for 430 yards. For reference, he had 347 yards in Week 5 at Arrowhead Stadium. He's settling back into the role he's played for years: being a solid quarterback, but not a game-wrecker. At 6-3, Jon Gruden has his team squarely in position to compete for one of the AFC's three wild card spots. The Raiders are playing inspired football and feeling confident, but that's exactly where the Chiefs should want them. In 'Raider Week: Act II,' we should see a completely different Chiefs team. They understand the gravity of this situation. After the loss in Act I, Mahomes acknowledged that the margin for error is very slim against quality opponents. ""We didn‚Äôt play our best football today and tried to battle at the end, but if we don‚Äôt play at a high enough level against good football teams, then you‚Äôll lose those games,"" he said. Getting the opponent's best shot each and every week is part of defending a title. This week, it's time for the Chiefs to send their best shot back.In 2020 ‚Äî a year filled with unfavorable outcomes ‚Äî the Chiefs have had just one of them. It was a game against a divisional opponent looking to make a statement. Reid and his players haven't forgotten about it, and they should come out this Sunday looking to make a statement of their own: The Raiders are not in the same stratosphere as them. Having an extra week to get ready was just the icing on the cake. Just as we thought the Kansas City Chiefs were going to steamroll their way through the AFC West for another year and take an unblemished divisional record into the playoffs, the Las Vegas Raiders had other ideas.Tucker D.

258,chiefs,https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/podcasts/the-chiefs-and-raiders-rivalry-is-alive-and-well,The Chiefs and Raiders Rivalry is Alive and Well,"Tucker D. FranklinJust as we thought the Kansas City Chiefs were going to steamroll their way through the AFC West for another year and take an unblemished divisional record into the playoffs, the Las Vegas Raiders had other ideas.As Chiefs Kingdom was getting comfortable in their seat on top, the Raiders came to Kansas City and pulled the chair out from under them.Arrowhead Report's Mark Van Sickle joins me on today's episode of Roughing the Kicker to discuss the history of the Chiefs-Raiders rivalry and the current state that it's in heading into Week 11 of the season.The Chiefs and Raiders rivalry is one of the most storied competitions in all of football, but it's been anything but competitive for the past few seasons. Kansas City's rise to the top and the Raiders' fall to mediocrity has lead to many one-sided streaks and not many back and forth outcomes.But now there is finally something to be excited about in the division. Vegas surprisingly beat the Chiefs in Week 5 and they rubbed it in. It was bad enough the Chiefs lost to an inferior team but a victory lap around the stadium gave Big Red and Co. all they need and more heading into this week's matchup with the Raiders.The extra animosity and the looming fact Kansas City could lose two straight to the Raiders gives this game ‚Äî and rivalry ‚Äî a feeling it hasn't had in a while. Competition. And I missed it.Yeah, Andy Reid's dominance amongst rivals has been nice, don't get me wrong, but there's just something about the division winner coming down to the last week of the season or having the divisional competition be the best competition that makes me feel alive.It's not wishing the Chiefs were the Chiefs of old, but it's wishing the Chargers and Raiders and Broncos were themselves of old. Las Vegas has finally brought that competition to the table. While they will probably get the doors blown off on Sunday considering the circumstances, it's exciting to have external storylines heading into the matchup.This isn't the first time these two teams will take some extra animosity into a game against the other but it has been like this in a while. With the Raiders beginning to play well and appearing to figure things out, it certainly won't be the last time either.

There are no greater certainties in life.Reid, who has the sixth-most wins among all head coaches in league history, has an 18-3 regular-season record when returning from a bye. Whether it be with the Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles, he's always had his teams in prime position to come back from a week off feeling refreshed, refocused, and ready to go. This season, a relatively late bye week couldn't have come at a better time for the Chiefs.Impact players like Sammy Watkins, Mitchell Schwartz and L'Jarius Sneed are working their way back from injury. The team currently boasts an 8-1 record, good for the No. 2 spot in the AFC. That one loss, a 40-32 defeat at the hands of the Las Vegas Raiders last month, is still fresh in the minds of many. Had the Chiefs handled business against a division rival, they'd be in a more ideal situation in regards to the home-field advantage race. By the time these two teams square off again on Sunday, Reid will have had two weeks to prepare. The stars are aligning for a revenge game, which now has even more storylines than usual thanks to a celebratory bus ride.Despite playing some of the sloppiest football of the Reid and Patrick Mahomes era, the reigning Super Bowl champs lost by a single score to Las Vegas last time out. The Chiefs were penalized 10 times for 94 yards. Raiders quarterback Derek Carr played the game of his life. Rookie wide receiver Henry Ruggs racked up 47 percent of his 2020 yards so far in that contest alone. Defensive coordinator Paul Guenther made a high-flying offense look completely beatable by getting pressure on Mahomes all day long. It was a perfect storm of events ‚Äî and one that likely won't happen again.In Carr's last three games, he's combined to throw for 430 yards. For reference, he had 347 yards in Week 5 at Arrowhead Stadium. He's settling back into the role he's played for years: being a solid quarterback, but not a game-wrecker. At 6-3, Jon Gruden has his team squarely in position to compete for one of the AFC's three wild card spots. The Raiders are playing inspired football and feeling confident, but that's exactly where the Chiefs should want them. In 'Raider Week: Act II,' we should see a completely different Chiefs team. They understand the gravity of this situation. After the loss in Act I, Mahomes acknowledged that the margin for error is very slim against quality opponents. ""We didn‚Äôt play our best football today and tried to battle at the end, but if we don‚Äôt play at a high enough level against good football teams, then you‚Äôll lose those games,"" he said. Getting the opponent's best shot each and every week is part of defending a title. This week, it's time for the Chiefs to send their best shot back."

Now, it is reportedly culminating in a spot on the Kansas City Chiefs' roster.Baker, who was released by the Giants following charges of armed robbery stemming from an incident in May, began getting a second look from some teams after those charges were dropped on Monday. As of Tuesday night, according to Mike Garafolo of NFL Network, Baker is now expected to sign with the Chiefs.Original accusations described Baker and Seattle Seahawks defensive back Quentin Dunbar as ""partaking in a brazen, multi-person robbery at a party in Miramar,"" as summarized by Michael McCann of SI.com: According to an affidavit filed by a Miramar detective in Broward County Circuit Court, problems at the party surfaced when Baker was seen with a gun in his hand and ‚Äúpointing it at one of the attendees.‚Äù
Baker, according to a witness whose name has been redacted, directed other attendees to take money and valuables from people at the party. Dunbar, the witness recalls, assisted Baker in taking these items. Another witness told police that at a different party two days earlier, Baker and Dunbar had lost about $70,000.However, the story took a turn on Monday, as the charges were dropped and an attorney was arrested due to an alleged extortion attempt, which Baker's lawyer said was where the story started in the first place, summarized by Ben Pickman of SI.com: ""I‚Äôve been saying this from Day 1, that this was an extortion scheme and that DeAndre was the victim,"" Baker's lawyer, Bradford Cohen, told the NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. ""This event did not play out as they insinuated. And the case was dismissed.""
On Monday morning William Dean, the attorney for three of the four men who said they were robbed, was arrested in Florida in conjunction with an alleged extortion attempt, according to the New York Post's Ryan Dunleavy.
According to the Post, Dean and his clients demanded $1.5 million from the former Giants cornerback and negotiated the number down to $800,000 to change their statements. However, no money ever changed hands, according to the Post.Baker, the 30th overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, now joins a cornerback room with Charvarius Ward, Bashaud Breeland, Rashad Fenton, L'Jarius Sneed, Antonio Hamilton and BoPete Keyes.Just as we thought the Kansas City Chiefs were going to steamroll their way through the AFC West for another year and take an unblemished divisional record into the playoffs, the Las Vegas Raiders had other ideas.Tucker D.

277,chiefs,https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/footenotes-travis-kelce-somehow-deserving-more-credit,Appreciate Travis Kelce While He's Playing: The Chiefs' Tight End is an All-Time Great,"Jordan FooteIn case you missed the memo, Travis Kelce is the best tight end in all of football. It isn't a debate. Even referring to him as a tight end feels like selling him short. He's not just one of the best tight ends in NFL history, he's one of the game's all-time greatest pass-catching threats.Kelce is a game-wrecker and a lethal weapon for the Kansas City Chiefs, and a downright horrifying sight for opposing defenses. A true matchup nightmare, players measuring up at 6'5"" and weighing 260 pounds shouldn't be allowed to move the way Kelce can. It simply is not fair. Despite having turned 31 years old on October 5, Kelce is in the middle of what could turn out to be the best season of his career. Through nine games, the two-time All-Pro ranks third in the NFL in receiving yards (769) and yards after the catch (361). He also has six touchdowns, topping the five he had all of last season. His chemistry with quarterback Patrick Mahomes is off the charts. Somehow, though, Kelce deserves even more respect.  Heading into Sunday's win over the Carolina Panthers, Kelce's name was atop the leaderboards in several other statistical categories. He led all tight ends with at least 200 snaps played in Pro Football Focus' grades for run blocking (79.5), receiving (89.6), and overall offense (90.3), putting up better grades than he ever has. His level of play isn't just elite ‚Äî it's all-time great. One of the main points of the George Kittle/Kelce debate for the game's best tight end was centered around run blocking. Kittle received rave reviews for his prowess in that area, while Kelce's quality performances were overlooked. Now, with the 49ers' best offensive player being banged up for most of this season and the Chiefs' leading receiver taking his game to another level, that conversation is over. With that, a new one should begin. It's time to give Kelce his flowers while he's still playing at such an exceptional level.Assuming he remains healthy for the remainder of this season, Kelce will have his fifth-consecutive 1,000-yard season. Heck, if he keeps playing like he has for the past two weeks (109 and 159 receiving yards, respectively), it won't take seven more games to get there. It's a near-lock that the NFL's longest streak that measures tight end greatness will be extended by yet another year. We've never seen anything like it, and we may never see it again. Seriously.Sure, Rob Gronkowski has a 17-touchdown season on his resume. He also had the physical gifts to be the best tight end ever. Health wasn't working in his favor, though. It is for Kelce. Chiefs legend and perhaps the current owner of the ""GOAT"" crown at the position, Tony Gonzalez, topped 1,000 yards four times in his 17-year career. The fact that Kelce has done it that many times in a row while competing for catches with other generational talents like Tyreek Hill is brilliant. It's astonishing. It's mind-boggling ‚Äî and Kelce doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. Kelce is healthy. He's consistently great. His unique physical gifts ‚Äî supreme agility mixed with great speed and size that makes him virtually impossible to cover individually ‚Äî are still at their peak. Even when those traits inevitably begin to decline, he's shown that he can refine his technique enough to make up for most of the difference. Oh yeah, he's also under contract to play with Mahomes until the end of the 2025 season.Acknowledge and enjoy this while it lasts. Kelce solidified his spot as the premier tight end in the NFL, but it's time to think even bigger. He's one of the best receiving threats this league currently has and by the time his already-amazing career comes to a close, he'll go down as a player future generations will aim to model their games after. In the midst of a special time to be a Chiefs fan, don't forget to realize the magnitude of a special talent performing as well as Kelce is.Just as we thought the Kansas City Chiefs were going to steamroll their way through the AFC West for another year and take an unblemished divisional record into the playoffs, the Las Vegas Raiders had other ideas.Tucker D.

Breeland is arguably the team‚Äôs best corner and will be joining a secondary that has been playing extremely well lately, allowing an average of 195 yards passing per game. They also have five interceptions making them one of the top ball-hawking secondaries in the league.Breeland may not start right away with how well the cornerbacks in Kansas City have been playing. Rashad Fenton has earned the right to start after a tremendous performance in Week 4 with four passes defended and an interception. Breeland will be available in case of injury or otherwise. Nonetheless, the addition of Breeland brings valuable depth to a position group that has struggled to stay healthy, so hopefully moving forward Kansas City has more stability at cornerback.(WATCH)!

FranklinWhile there are many Kansas City Chiefs players who are household names, some don't get the public credit they deserve for making the Chiefs as successful as they are.On today's episode of Roughing the Kicker, Arrowhead Report's Conner Christopherson joined me to discuss these players and what they have excelled at this season. LT Eric FisherThe Chiefs left tackle has been their best offensive lineman this season. Fisher has a Pro Football Focus grade of 80.3 and has run and pass blocking grades of 75.6. When there have been problems arise on the offensive line, it hasn't been Fisher who is creating the problems. The 29-year-old is having one of the best years of his career and has possibly extended his time with the team that took him first overall in 2013.  WR Demarcus RobinsonRobinson has stepped up in the absence of Sammy Watkins. Robinson's ability to work with Patrick Mahomes when he scrambles is what has made the 26-year-old so effective this year. After returning on a one-year deal, Robinson has hauled in 21 catches for 220 yards and two scores this season. With the wide receiver in a contract year, his production for the rest of the year could dictate the market for him in 2021.DT Tershawn WhartonWho would have thought an undrafted free agent from Missouri S&T would be one of the Chiefs' main defensive linemen? Wharton gained a lot of praise out of training camp and has shown he deserved it since the first game of the season. Wharton has received more playing time with injuries along the defensive front and has even taken the place of Mike Pennel. According to PFF, he has the fourth-best defensive grade in Kansas City and has shown his best in the run-stopping game.CB Rashad FentonIn a small sample size last season, Fenton played well. As the season began this year, the 23-year-old was thrust into a starting role with Bashaud Breeland out with a suspension. He's been able to increase his role as Breeland has returned from suspension and has continued to play well. Fenton's 71.9 PFF grade is good enough for 18th-best in the league at his position and his 75.1 coverage grade is the best on the team.

293,chiefs,https://www.si.com/nfl/chiefs/gm-report/clark-hunt-reflects-over-extension-of-hc-andy-reid-gm-brett-veach,"Clark Hunt Discusses Extensions of Head Coach Andy Reid, GM Brett Veach","Joe AndrewsOn January 3, 2013, Kansas City Chiefs Chairman and CEO Clark Hunt flew to Philadelphia for a meeting with recently fired Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid.The attempt to fill the Chiefs‚Äô head coach vacancy, which Hunt recalled during a press conference Monday, was scheduled to last three or four hours. It ended after nine hours and stopped Reid from flying to an interview in Phoenix with the Arizona Cardinals.A day later, Hunt named Reid as the Chiefs‚Äô 13th head coach ‚Äî the third appointment he made to the position since 2009. The rest is history, with more stories yet to be written.‚ÄúThe short answer is I smile a whole lot more,‚Äù Hunt said of how he's changed as an owner since hiring Reid in 2013. ‚ÄúIf you just think about the journey that we've been on over the last eight years, when we hired Andy, we were obviously coming off of several very difficult seasons and the turnaround with Andy was almost immediate, going 9-0 his first season in Kansas City. And to his credit, he‚Äôs done nothing but get better, and that‚Äôs helped our football team get better.‚ÄùHunt and the Chiefs announced the contract extension of Reid and general manager Brett Veach on Monday, though the deal slated to last until 2025 was originally reported at the end of August.Veach followed Reid to Kansas City from Philadelphia in 2013. His stay began as a co-director of player personnel under general manager John Dorsey until ultimately replacing him in July 2017.‚ÄúWhen Brett became the GM three and a half years ago, he had some areas that he had to grow into,‚Äù Hunt said. ‚ÄúHe had to learn the cap management side of the business, and he‚Äôs done a fantastic job on that. I think we can all say we‚Äôre surprised that he was able to accomplish everything that he was able to accomplish this past summer in terms of signing our veteran players. I also knew that he was a really good evaluator.‚ÄùWith Reid as head coach, the Chiefs hold an 85-36 regular-season record, with just 15 of the losses arriving after Veach was promoted to general manager. Kansas City has been to the playoffs in six of the last seven seasons. Together, Reid and Veach replaced and overhauled a defense formerly led by defensive coordinator Bob Sutton, bringing in Steve Spagnuolo along with defensive end Frank Clark and safety Tyrann Mathieu.That defensive retooling helped lead the Chiefs to win Super Bowl LIV a year after falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.‚ÄúOne of the things I think that‚Äôs most important to the success that we‚Äôve had is how he and Andy work together,‚Äù Hunt said. ‚ÄúAnd of course, they came with the pre-existing relationship from Philadelphia, so that was something that I knew we were getting, but it‚Äôs probably been better than I had thought. That dynamic is really great. A lot of times you can have tension between your GM and head coach, but the two of them really work together hand-and-hand.‚ÄùVeach went to work on paving the way to the Chiefs‚Äô third Lombardi Trophy in the offseason, extending the contracts of quarterback Patrick Mahomes through 2031, tight end Travis Kelce through 2025 and defensive tackle Chris Jones through 2023.Reid has worked towards the same goal, leading the Chiefs to an 8-1 start to the season while guiding his players to avoid complacency.Hunt said the consistency carried over from last year‚Äôs championship gives him the same hope he had when he brought Reid to Kansas City eight seasons ago.‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to look to the future because I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been any change in his energy level, and just the way the players respond to him, they‚Äôre excited to come to practice every day, excited to play for him and fully on board with our goals to win world championships,‚Äù Hunt said.
